And at least 15 per cent \u2013 more than 544,000 \u2013 are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half\u00a0of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,'\u00a0according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF? A woman cast as a kindly, gardening grandma in Clinton's campaign launch video is actually a former abortion lobbyist who once helmed a campaign for Texas state Senator Wendy Davis WHERE'S SCOOBY? Clinton's caravan was spotted in Maumee, Ohio on Monday when she lunched at Chipotle, but no one recognized her Facebook says it has entire teams of employees tasked with rooting out schemes to artificially boost statistics.

As renting in the capital soared to an average of more than \u00a31,100 per month, the second year history and politics student who attends a London university told how she took up sex work\u2013 even visiting some clients at their workplace. Speaking through the English Collective of Prostitutes', the woman \u2013 who asked to remain anonymous \u2013 spoke after a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry. A University student has revealed how she turned to sex work after her student loan failed to cover her rent (picture posed by model) The survey conducted by the University of Swansea further revealed that nearly five per cent of them had actually worked in the sex industry. The young woman said that she didn't immediately turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after conventional means of work failed to support her. She said: 'I started working after my first year and tried various part time jobs: in a coffee shop, a pub and as a waitress. None paid enough. 'The student loan didn't cover even my housing, let alone living expenses, food, books and travel costs.' She added that money worries meant she began to struggle academically as well as financially. 'I had trouble keeping up with course work, especially if I worked evenings. 'For example at the pub, I'd earn \u00a37 an hour for an eight hour shift, two nights a week, so I'd bring home about \u00a3100 weekly. 'I'd just moved to London from the north of England. My family are not well off, so cannot afford to help me much. The student says that traditional means of earning failed to cover the cost of living in London 'I didn't know anyone in London so when I moved here it was starting from scratch.' Initially she lived in student accommodation in the city but says that working as a prostitute enabled her to afford somewhere better. 'It was an overcrowded, noisy flat with other students,' she said of her halls. She moved into her own home after she began to advertise her services. 'I could afford a place of my own. I advertise through a website and have regular clients. 'I visit them at home, in hotels and occasionally at their workplace.' Despite sex work not being an ideal situation the student says that it had been beneficial towards her studies. 'It is flexible and fits around my course. 'I can work the hours I want to and scale back around exam time or if I have extra course work.' The woman heard about sex work from other students who had also been looking for a way to earn extra money. 'In my first year at university I started hearing about students turning to sex work,' she said. 'After a time I met someone on another course who'd been working as a stripper in a bar. 'Through her I met another student doing escorting, she clued me in, said where to advertise, and how to avoid bad clients and work safely. 'She gave me the English Collective of Prostitutes' Rights sheet which tells about the laws and how they work. Although her new means of earning have enabled her to continue studying in London the woman says she does not particularly enjoy her work. 'My biggest worry is about being arrested because if I get a criminal record it would stay with me for life. It would be massive obstacle to getting other jobs.' However she remains adamant that this is the best option for her after seeing other friends trying alternative routes. 'Sex work is far batter paid and suits my time more than any other work I know of. 'Friends at university are working 10 hour shifts for under the minimum wage. Others are working on zero hour contracts and never know how many hours they will get. 'Sometimes they get none at all so it is very hard to budget and pay bills. 'I know students who've dropped out and left courses due to financial pressures.' However she is well aware of the risks she is taking and says she takes appropriate precautions to avoid being found out. 'Mostly students doing sex work don't talk about it. If it comes out, it could affect your future and job prospects.' The student's story may seem like a rare case but she says that it is become more regular practice in universities: 'Since I started escorting I've heard that a former roommate exchanged sex with her landlord to cover the rent. 'Another woman I know worked as a part time sex worker to earn enough to travel home to visit her family. 'Sex work among students is much more common than people think, and it is likely to increase as long as fees, rent and the cost of living is so high.'", "reference": "a student has revealed she turned to sex work to cover the cost of living and studying in london . she tried regular work but still struggled to pay the bills . she says that sex work is becoming common practice among students .", "sentences": ["more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry .", "the young woman said she did n't turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after her student loan failed to cover her rent .", "the university of swansea said five per cent of them had worked in sex industry ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "LinkE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CircE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that a research project revealed more than a fifth of students have thought about being involved in the sex industry.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the young woman said she did n't turn to prostitution but used it as a last resort after her student loan failed to cover her rent .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript reports that the woman said she didn\u2019t immediately turn to prostitution and only used it as a last resort when her student loan and other part-time work failed to cover her housing and living costs.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the university of swansea said five per cent of them had worked in sex industry .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript notes that a survey conducted by the University of Swansea revealed nearly five per cent of students had worked in the sex industry; summarizing this as \\\"five per cent\\\" is a faithful rounding.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.Media playback is not supported on this deviceGeorgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked. We kept the ball down the other end, and when they gave it back to us, we managed to counter-attack and get points.In the second half, the game seemed to open up a little, it was a wet ball and it was cold out there, so the transmissions weren't as neat and quick as we'd like. And they were very good over the ball.But I thought we did things pragmatically, kept them out of it and scored points when we had to.I think there's been a good shift in the way we approach these games and manage them, and Greig (Laidlaw)'s done a great job in that with his guys around him.

Carver was in a rage again on Sunday night, but this time it was his players feeling the fury. 'I said before the game that no side of mine would be criticised for not working hard enough. I was wrong,' he said. Jordi Gomez and Remy Cabella do battle on the Stadium of Light pitch as Sunderland snatch victory 'The performance hurts more than the result. We were second best. It's a funny thing pressure, some players can handle it and some can't. Some of ours perhaps can't after losing five in a row. 'I am absolutely embarrassed to be part of it.' Newcastle's problem is a sad attitude of acceptance that has been allowed to permeate a squad lacking in ability and character. The Magpie mandate is survival and, to that end, their season finished the minute they were more or less assured of as much. Not even a derby can rally this lot. There was one incident in the second half which captured their passive approach. With the play dead, Mike Williamson had to scream at team-mate Daryl Janmaat in a desperate effort to return the ball with some sense of urgency. Sunderland, in contrast, hassled, harried and hounded their opponents. They had won the previous four derbies because they out-worked Newcastle and wanted it more. They won a fifth for exactly the same reasons. Jermain Defoe earns Sunderland all three points with a sensational volley at the Stadium of Light This was billed as 'The Desperation Derby' given the alarming form of the North-East rivals going into the game \u2013 four goals between them in 18 hours with six points taken from a possible 36. But there was only one team desperate to win this. It wasn't until the final 15 minutes that Newcastle drew a save from Costel Pantilimon. But it was too little, too late. Far too little, in fact. These are dispiriting times on Tyneside. The disconnect between supporters, players and hierarchy has never been greater. On full-time, the Toon Army spat as much venom towards their own team as they did the red-and-whites goading them nearby. They had just witnessed a dour display of nothingness, sadly lacking in energy, imagination and pride. Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul can only look on in horror as the striker's effort cruises in There was one shining light amid the darkness. Cancer survivor Jonas Gutierrez was starting his first game in 20 months and was by some distance the only player in grey worthy of applause, and that he rightly received. His shirt was soaked near-enough black come the end such was his effort. It failed, however, to inspire his team-mates, one of which, Tim Krul, was criticised by fans on social media when it appeared he congratulated Jermain Defoe for his stunning match-winner shortly before half-time. But to demonise Krul alone would be wrong. The problems at Newcastle run from top to bottom. They are a club without ambition, happy to renew their Premier League pay packet come the end of the season. That message from above means you end up with performances such as this \u2013 grey, with little sign of light.

Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation. Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling. Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of the conflict a defeat.

Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down. Spahic is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday through injury but he could be in line for a longer spell on the sidelines if action is taken after the incident on Wednesday night. Bayer are fourth in the Bundesliga, two points behind Borussia Monchengladbach in the race for a Champions League place and trailing runaway leaders Bayern by 19 points.
