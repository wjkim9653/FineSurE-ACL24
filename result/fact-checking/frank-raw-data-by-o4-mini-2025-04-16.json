Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.", "reference": "manchester city were beaten 4-2 by manchester united at old trafford . defeat leaves city fourth in premier league , four points behind man united . man city desperately need to strengthen an ageing squad in the summer . and it remains to be see whether city will stick with manuel pellegrini . but the biggest challenge could be keeping hold of sergio aguero . argentine scored a brace against united to take his tally for city to 100 .", "sentences": ["manchester city beat manchester city 2-1 at old trafford on sunday .", "aguero scored his 100th premier league goal for city in the summer .", "aguero scored his 100th goal for city in the premier league last 16 ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE", "NoE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "NoE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "CircE", "CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"manchester city beat manchester city 2-1 at old trafford on sunday .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The summary claims Man City beat themselves 2-1 at Old Trafford, whereas the transcript describes Manchester City losing 2-1 to Manchester United at Old Trafford.\",  \n    \"category\": \"entity error\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"aguero scored his 100th premier league goal for city in the summer .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The transcript celebrates Aguero\u2019s 100th goal for City in all competitions during a derby defeat in spring, not specifically his 100th Premier League goal or in the summer.\",  \n    \"category\": \"entity error\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"aguero scored his 100th goal for city in the premier league last 16 .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The phrase \u2018Premier League last 16\u2019 never appears in the transcript and invents a circumstance not mentioned.\",  \n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"  \n  }  \n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "entity error", "out-of-context error"]}

Those qualities must have been there in the man.The portrait was painted by renowned American artist Tim O'Brien, and will be projected onto buildings around the orchestra's home towns of Newcastle and Gateshead over the coming months.Regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time, Mozart wrote more than 600 works, including some of the most celebrated and enduring pieces of classical music, before he died at the age of 35.Only 14 images of the composer are known to have been created during his lifetime, but many are stylised or incomplete.The best physical description came from baritone Luigi Bassi, for whom Mozart had written the role of Don Giovanni.Mr Mozart was an extremely eccentric and absent-minded young man, but not without a certain spirit of pride, he said. He was very popular with the ladies, in spite of his small size; but he had a most unusual face, and he could cast a spell on any woman with his eyes.Describing the existing portraits as cosy and pretty, O'Brien explained the thinking behind his new painting.I know of few musicians of real depth where you can't see some of that complexity in the face.  So to find the Mozart who was obsessively driven, who pushed boundaries and who lived in a world where harsh poverty and crime were a very real facts, I looked at musicians from our own era to provide some inspiration.Photos of Johnny Cash and Eric Clapton suggested both obsession and some kind of danger. Johnny Rotten provided a certain precocious brilliance, and I related to those for Mozart.O'Brien previously made headlines by creating a portrait of Beethoven for the cover of Gramophone magazine, which was inspired by U2 singer Bono.The portrait accompanies the Northern Sinfonia's new season, which includes a series of concerts called Reclaiming Mozart.They begin on Friday, 18 September with the first movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 25, and will also include his Clarinet Concerto and the rarely performed Symphony No. 33.Musical director Vogt will be the soloist in the Quintet for Piano and Wind, of which Mozart once wrote: I myself consider it to be the best thing I have written in my life.The German concert pianist and conductor, who recently played the first night of the Proms, is an avowed Mozart fan - whose desert island disc would be a box set of the composer's works.In his first season as director of the Sinfonia, he plans to stage a number of pop-up concerts in venues that echo the darker corners of Vienna that Mozart would have frequented in the 18th Century.", "reference": "a new portrait of mozart imagines the composer as a ``daring\\'\\'and ``edgy\\'\\'musician in the mould of johnny rotten.", "sentences": ["a new portrait of mozart music is being commissioned by the royal orchestra for the first time."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "LinkE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"a new portrait of mozart music is being commissioned by the royal orchestra for the first time.\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The summary wrongly describes the work as a 'portrait of Mozart music' rather than a portrait of Mozart himself and adds an unsupported claim 'for the first time'; it also misnames the commissioner as 'royal orchestra' instead of Royal Northern Sinfonia.\",  \n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"  \n  }  \n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as dismemberment abortion and defines as knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus. Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if necessary to protect the life or health of the mother, according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law protecting life at its most vulnerable stage. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability. Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S., the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes will be many state laws. This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States, she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States.

May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return.

GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "reference": "richie benaud died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . his commentary style is considered synonymous with cricket . sportsmail recalls 10 of his best moments in the commentary box . read : when richie benaud welcomed viewers , they were able to relax . click here for richie benaud tributes as cricket world mourns legend .", "sentences": ["richie benaud dies at 84 after battling skin cancer .", "he was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's record .", "benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's record ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"richie benaud dies at 84 after battling skin cancer .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"This aligns with the transcript stating that Richie Benaud died at age 84 after a short battle with skin cancer.\",  \n    \"category\": \"no error\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"he was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's record .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The transcript mentions Benaud talking viewers through Shane Warne's first Test delivery (the 'Ball of the Century'), not a record; calling it a 'record' contradicts the transcript.\",  \n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's record .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"This repeats the same incorrect claim about a 'record' instead of the specific 'first Test delivery' highlighted in the transcript.\",  \n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"  \n  }  \n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "predicate error", "predicate error"]}

May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return. He later tried to clarify his comments by saying 'we have four children to raise and a lot of things to do' - but many pointed out that he still easily sits in the wealthiest 1 per cent of his home state.", "reference": "mary pat christie , 51 , quit her position at finance firm angleo gordon & co . reportedly told colleagues the move would precede a christie campaign . mrs christie earns almost three times as much as her husband . has accompanied new jersey governor on putative campaign trail .", "sentences": ["mary pat christie , 51 , has quit her $ 475,000-a-year position at finance firm angelo gordon &", "the official reason for the resignation was ' to spend more time with her family and young children ' .", "but many will see the move as a sign that new jersey governor christie is coming closer to seeking the republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CorefE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\":\"mary pat christie , 51 , has quit her $ 475,000-a-year position at finance firm angelo gordon &\",\"reason\":\"This aligns exactly with the transcript\u2019s statement that Mary Pat Christie, 51, left her $475,000-a-year role at Angelo Gordon & Co.\",\"category\":\"no error\"},{\"sentence\":\"the official reason for the resignation was ' to spend more time with her family and young children ' .\",\"reason\":\"This directly matches the transcript\u2019s quoted reason for her resignation.\",\"category\":\"no error\"},{\"sentence\":\"but many will see the move as a sign that new jersey governor christie is coming closer to seeking the republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election .\",\"reason\":\"This reflects the transcript\u2019s point that observers interpret her resignation as a signal of Gov.

Murray cost Palace nothing when joined from arch rivals Brighton in 2011. Jason Puncheon, signed for a comparative pittance of \u00a31.9m, delivered City their final blow with a goal from a finely executed free-kick.

Bouchard was a semi-finalist last year but had struggled in the lead-up to the Charlston green-clay event, losing three of her last five matches to lower-ranked opponents. Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set. Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead.

Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor.Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days.Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on.Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession.He added: In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level.These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government.Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: The Scottish government will have \u00a3390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to \u00a3750m if you include its own underspend.The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost \u00a330bn.One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government.The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance.Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real.Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget.Scotland needs a government that spends less time congratulating itself on its spin and more time explaining its record.Scottish Labour will offer a real alternative to austerity, with different decisions on tax to the Tories, and different decisions on tax to the SNP.", "reference": "finance secretary john swinney has warned of ``tough choices\\'\\'facing scotland as he prepares to set out his budget.", "sentences": ["scotland\\'s finance secretary john swinney has said he is ``extremely optimistic\\'\\'about the uk"], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\":\"scotland's finance secretary john swinney has said he is \\\"extremely optimistic\\\" about the uk\",\"reason\":\"The transcript contains no statement by John Swinney describing himself as \\\"extremely optimistic\\\" about the UK; this invented predicate contradicts his critical remarks.\",\"category\":\"predicate error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list.

Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'", "reference": "the glasgow duo have played nearly 300 games between them . al kellock and dougie hall will both retire at the end of the season . glasgow face cardiff blues at scotstoun on friday night .", "sentences": ["Glasgow Warriors host Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night .", "Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start in the pack for the Warriors .", "The match ball will be presented by Kellock 's dad and Hall 's mum .", "Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Glasgow Warriors host Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Glasgow Warriors will play Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will both start in the pack for the Warriors .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms both Al Kellock and Dougie Hall will start in the pack for the match.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"The match ball will be presented by Kellock 's dad and Hall 's mum .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript specifies that the match ball will be presented by Kellock\u2019s dad and Hall\u2019s mum (among others).\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript notes that Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match due to a calf strain.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final.

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. \u2018The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. \u2018It is high time the OFB model of food bank \u2013 which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty \u2013 is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.\u2019", "reference": "the trussell trust counted the number of people visiting its 445 branches . the charity hands out three-day food parcels to people requiring help . critics claim that people will come forward if free food is on offer . tories said getting people working was better than providing hand-outs .", "sentences": ["figures from the trussell trust were seized on by labour and tuc as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so-called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits .", "but tory benefits chief iain duncan smith questioned the numbers , which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019 , and insisted the best way to help families was to get people into work ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"figures from the trussell trust were seized on by labour and tuc as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , the so-called bedroom tax , and stopped benefits .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This sentence directly reflects the transcript\u2019s statement that Labour and the TUC described the Trussell Trust figures as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food due to low pay, the bedroom tax, and stopped benefits.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but tory benefits chief iain duncan smith questioned the numbers , which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019 , and insisted the best way to help families was to get people into work .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This sentence accurately mirrors the transcript\u2019s statement that Iain Duncan Smith called the figures 'unverified' and said the best way to support families is by increasing employment.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error"]}

May Pat Christie, 51, a managing director at New York City finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co, ditched her $475,000-a-year position this week, a family spokesman confirmed. The official reason for the resignation was 'to spend more time with her family and young children'. But many will see the move as a sign that New Jersey governor Christie, 52, is coming closer to seeking the Republican nomination for the 2016 presidential election. Scroll down for video Ditching Wall Street: Mary Pat Christie, right, has quit her $475,000-a-year position at finance firm Angelo Gordon & Co According to Fox Business, she had previously told colleagues that her leaving would be a precursor to her husband's run. She is often seen out on the campaign trail with Christie, making a recent appearance in New Hampshire - a necessary stop for would-be presidents. Earlier this month the Christies said they were undecided about what Mary Pat should do with her job, and seemed to downplay the chances of her quitting. Christie said then that leaving a career would be 'a big sacrifice for a spouse to make', and that it also 'wouldn't be a requirement', even if he did run for president. More of this? The move is likely a precursor to Christie's bid for president - which would entail a lot of campaigning from Mrs Christie, pictured above with her husband in New Hampshire Her decision mirrors that of another Wall Street Republican spouse - Ted Cruz's wife, Heidi. Mrs Cruz, whose husband was the first to launch his presidential campaign, immediately took unpaid leave from her high-powered position at Goldman Sachs, and will stay away from the office for the duration of his campaign. Mrs Christie's departure from her job will mean a major dip in the Christies' income. The family's latest tax returns, from 2013, revealed that she brought in the lion's share of the family's earnings. Not the breadwinner: Christie's family tax returns show that his wife earns almost three times as much as him She reported a $510,000 total salary, made up of the $475,000 managing director's pay packet and around $35,000 from a side job as a bond trader. In the same year Christie's gubernatorial salary was $175,000. However, during his visit to a New Hampshire newspaper's editorial board he insisted his family is 'not wealthy by current standards' when complaining about the complexity of his tax return.

On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals. But O'Sullivan was also spoken to by the referee Olivier Marteel towards the end of the afternoon session - and warned about his behaviour. Ronnie O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Olivier Marteel in his second round match against Matthew Stevens O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Marteel in his second round match against Stevens at the Crucible Marteel approached O'Sullivan as he walked to the table when Stevens missed a red, telling O'Sullivan he had noticed his hand gesture, which was thought to have been self-directed.

Nor did he accept that the fall of Aleppo was also due to a failure of US diplomatic strategy. You can't make someone do something through diplomacy that they're not prepared to negotiate, he told me.Critics in Washington, though, have slammed the Obama administration for refusing to back that diplomacy with the threat of credible force, giving Mr Kerry very little to work with other than good faith.Some have faulted the secretary of state for having too much faith in Russia's willingness for a deal - delusional diplomacy, the Washington Post called it.Mr Kerry made clear he would continue his tireless efforts to reach a peace deal. But the fall of Aleppo almost certainly means he has run out of time to do so in the waning weeks of this administration, and the Syria crisis will be passed on to the next one.Syrian state media said rebels had blown up their ammunition dumps and destroyed documents before leaving the city.A statement from the Russian Centre for the Reconciliation of Opposing Sides in Syria, part of Russia's ministry of defence, said the Syrian authorities had guaranteed the safety of all members of the armed groups who decided to leave Aleppo.The rebels confirmed a fresh ceasefire had come into effect at 03:00 GMT and that a new deal had been agreed.As operations began, an ambulance service official in eastern Aleppo said that one convoy of ambulances had been shot at, with three people injured.The White Helmets civil defence group tweeted that one senior volunteer had been shot and injured by a sniper while clearing an evacuation route for ambulances.Buses and ambulances are taking the injured, civilians and rebel fighters to the neighbouring province of Idlib, most of which is controlled by a powerful rebel alliance that includes the jihadist group Jabhat Fateh al-Sham.The buses left Aleppo via the road through the government-controlled south-western district of Ramousseh, heading towards the nearby rebel-held towns of Khan Touman and Khan al-Asal.The chief of the Russian military's General Staff, Gen Valery Gerasimov, told a news briefing: A humanitarian corridor has been created for the evacuation of militants.This corridor is 21km long, he said, adding, 6km lie across Aleppo's territories controlled by government troops and another 15km through territories in the hands of illegal armed groups.Turkey, which helped to broker the evacuation, is preparing to receive some of the most vulnerable civilians, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.In a televised address, he said Turkey would take children, elders, those who are really in difficult conditions.The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Kinik, told reporters that the wounded would be the first to be transferred.UN Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura said about 50,000 people were still trapped and he warned that moving those evacuated to Idlib might not prove much safer.If there is no political agreement and a ceasefire, Idlib will become the next Aleppo, he told reporters in Paris.The 50,000 are said to include about 4,000 fighters and about 10,000 of their family members.Aleppo's besieged residents have faced weeks of bombardment and chronic food and fuel shortages.Russian Lt Gen Viktor Poznikhir said on Thursday that, with the evacuation, the Syrian armed forces had almost finished their operations in Aleppo. Fighting has raged there for four years.In October, President Assad said victory in Aleppo would be the springboard... to liberate other areas from terrorists, a term the government uses to describe all rebel fighters.He singled out Idlib province, west of Aleppo, that is almost entirely controlled by an alliance of Islamist rebel factions and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, formerly known as al-Nusra Front.Idlib contains border crossings used by rebels to receive supplies from Turkey, a key backer.

Fighters from 100 nations \u2013 more than half the countries in the world \u2013 have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in \u2018a veritable \u201cinternational finishing school\u201d for extremists\u2019 as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March \u2013 three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters \u2018is higher than it has ever been historically\u2019. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has \u2018risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,\u2019 the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the \u2018watch list\u2019 in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it\u2019s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the \u2018high number\u2019of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks \u2018pose an immediate and long-term threat\u2019 and \u2018an urgent global security problem\u2019 that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack \u2018is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues\u2019. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is \u2018generating public panic\u2019 and stressed that the response needs to \u2018be measured, effective and proportionate.\u2019 It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters.

Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away. 'I knew it was either Summer or our son Sam, who was living in digs in Birmingham at the time while at university. 'As soon as they said Summer's name, I knew something had happened.' Miss Robertson's death came soon after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown. Summer, fourth from left helping to deliver Christmas presents.\u00a0death came just after she landed her dream job as an apprentice in the parts department at Hatfield Jaguar in her hometown Summer, pictured as a youngster at school, left, and celebrating her birthday. Her family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to her And while they are heartbroken over their daughter's death, her parents say they take great comfort from the fact that she died doing something she loved. Her mother said: 'It has motivated us to want to do something positive in her memory. 'We've decided to take a leaf out of Summer's book, and not take life so seriously. 'Now I don't mind so much if the phone doesn't work. There's more to life than worrying about work and paying the mortgage. 'That's only stuff, as Summer would say.' The family have now launched an appeal to raise money for Guide Dogs for the Blind as a tribute to Miss Robertson. It came after \u00a31,500 was donated to the appeal through a collection at her funeral.

Marie Teresa Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against a raft of misconduct charges, choosing not to show up at her fitness to practise hearing at the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). She also declined to send a lawyer in her place. The panel has been told Ms Ratcliffe accepts 77 allegations relating to her care and treatment of 14 patients at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital in Cumbria between February 2004 and September 2013. Former midwife Marie Ratcliffe refused to defend herself against 77 misconduct charges at a fitness to practise hearing in front of the Nursing and Midwifery Council. She worked at the scandal-hit Furness General Hospital where Joshua Titcombe, pictured, died at just nine days old They include the allegations that, in relation to two babies - one of whom died in February 2004 and another in September 2008 - Ms Ratcliffe's conduct 'contributed to the death' of, and/or caused the patient's baby 'to lose a significant chance of survival'. The allegations against Ms Ratcliffe also included claims she failed to adequately monitor patients, record key observations in patient notes or request assistance from doctors. Amanda Hamilton, representing the NMC, read out a letter written by Ms Ratcliffe which said that she will 'regret what happened for the rest of my life'. Ms Ratcliffe told the panel she is no longer a midwife, and has no intentions of returning to the profession. In the letter read to the NMC panel, sitting in Stratford, east London, Ms Ratcliffe said: 'I am a human being of good will and I accept that I have made mistakes and apologise to those affected by them.' In the letter, Ms Ratcliffe said she felt 'it was important not to delay' proceedings any further or efforts for people to look in to what happened by 'defending myself against these charges'. She denied being part of any cover-up or collusion of what had happened or effort to 'conceal the truth'. In March, an independent investigation into what happened at Furness General Hospital between 2004 and 2013, found failures led to the avoidable deaths of 11 babies and one mother Marie Ratcliffe is the first of eight midwives accused of misconduct and poor care at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay Foundation Trust to appear before the NMC. In March, the independent inquiry into the failings at Morecambe Bay, led by Bill Kirkup, found failures at the trust led to the avoidable deaths of at least 11 babies and one mother. Feuding medics, an obsession with natural childbirth, and a tight knit group of midwives who dubbed themselves 'The Musketeers' contributed to a 'distressing chain of events' which led to avoidable harm to mothers and babies, at Furness General Hospital in Barrow, Cumbria. The independent investigation into serious incidents at the hospital between 2004 and 2013 uncovered a series of failures 'at every level' - from the maternity unit to those responsible for regulating and monitoring the trust which runs the unit. The report slammed the clinical competence of staff, a 'them and us' culture between midwives, obstetricians and paeditricians and an over-zealous pursuit of natural childbirth 'at all costs' by a small group of dominant midwives. It found 'shocking' substandard clinical competence, extremely poor working relationships between different staff groups and repeated failure to investigate adverse incidents properly and learn lessons. And the report suggests that when babies died, midwives conspired to cover up the failings. In total eight midwives who worked at the trust could face disciplinary action. The NMC said last year that four midwives should face hearings. Meanwhile another four midwives are still the subject of further investigations. She noted that the system had been flawed but that she was governed by those procedures. She stated that 'in writing these words I seek no leniency' adding 'I accept things I cannot change.' Panel chairman Gary Leong said: 'By her letter Ms Ratcliffe is aware of the proceedings. 'She has voluntarily absented herself. She is very clear that she does not wish to defend herself against these charges. 'In light of that the panel considers that an adjournment would not change the circumstances. She does not wish to come.' He said the hearing is a matter of public interest, and as such will continue today. The proceedings will hear from two of the women who were under the care of the former midwife when they lost their baby. The hearing was told about the first incident occurred in 2004 in relation to the mother referred to a Patient A. Ms Hamilton, for the NMC, said another midwife present at the birth said the baby 'was placed by the side of Patient A and appeared purple, blue and lifeless'. The baby was taken to a specialist unit in Liverpool Women's Hospital where it died on February 26, 2004. The second death of a baby occurred in September 2008. Other allegations she faces in regards to the Patient B's baby include a failure to record or observe maternal blood pressure and that she failed to adequately monitor and/or ensure the foetal heart rate was normal.

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word genocide to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a genocide as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence, he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities.

The Prime Minister said he will amend the Working Times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor, and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday. But business leaders criticised the move as\u00a0heavy-handed government intervention', amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for. Scroll down for video Happy handshake: The Prime Minister met staff and volunteers at the Age UK Day Centre in Plymouth today Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society good deeds scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff The policy will apply to workers at firms with at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the private sector and five million in the public sector. Volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly. Announcing the policy Mr Cameron said: 'This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. The foundation stone of that better future is our economic security. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. 'This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action - and I'm proud it's a Conservative government that will deliver it.' But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors (IoD), criticised the announcement, saying the policy did not appear to have been thought through. 'Many, many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes, and the IoD thoroughly supports them. Passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy. 'Businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer, but the architects of this idea cannot pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs. Time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves, not a target for heavy-handed government intervention. 'This announcement not only undermines the Tory record on reducing business regulation, it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers, and ultimately the taxpayer. Frankly, the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary. The IoD would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering, but it has to be a choice.' Mr Cameron's plan will affect around 15 million workers across Great Britain in private and public sectors Survival expert and Television star Bear Grylls said that he supports Mr Cameron's volunteering scheme The plan was praised by the chairman of BT Mike Rake.\u00a0He said: 'Corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community, a win for individuals doing the volunteering, and a win for companies.' Survival expert and TV star Bear Grylls also lent Mr Cameron his support for the scheme.\u00a0'Any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news,' he said. 'All of us struggle to find extra time and that's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the UK.' However, just hours after Cameron's announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees, suggesting the policy would be unworkable. 'Nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company,' Mr Pickles told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added there would need to be 'a bit of give and take' with the Prime Minister's plan. The Communities Secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the NHS, with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers. 'We're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it doesn't cause inconvenience to the health service,' he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Mr Pickles had given a 'car crash' interview. He tweeted: 'If yesterday's Michael Fallon interview was a car crash, Eric Pickles just caused a motorway pile-up #r4today.' Mr Pickles suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days-off for volunteering under the plan Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott offered his view on Pickles' interview on the Today programme The Labour party raised concerns about the cost of the policy. Shadow minister Lisa Nandy said: 'This is a re-announcement from David Cameron that has unravelled before it's even been made. 'Giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there's no sense of how it will be paid for. If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers.'", "reference": "prime minister announced plan to amend working times regulations . mr cameron wants workers to have three paid days off to do good deeds . he described announcement as demonstration of the big society in action . immediately afterwards eric pickles suggested it would n't be enforced . john prescott described mr pickles ' interview as a ` car-crash ' .", "sentences": ["david cameron said he will amend working times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor .", "but business leaders criticised the move as heavy-handed government intervention .", "policy will apply to workers at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the public sector ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "EntE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["LinkE", "NoE", "EntE", "CircE", "GramE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"david cameron said he will amend working times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This matches the transcript exactly: Cameron announced amending the Working Times regulations to allow three days of paid volunteering or school governor service.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but business leaders criticised the move as heavy-handed government intervention .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that business leaders criticised the policy as \u201cheavy-handed government intervention,\u201d so this is factually consistent.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"policy will apply to workers at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the public sector .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says the 10 million estimate refers to the private sector, not the public sector, so the sector attribution is incorrect.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "entity error"]}

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege.

The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility.

One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days.

Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months\u2019 notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith\u2019s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. \u2018If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn\u2019t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.\u2019 The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. \u2018But if he isn\u2019t compos mentis, there\u2019s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he\u2019s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? \u2018It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.\u2019 Janner\u2019s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children\u2019s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government\u2019s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. \u2018Of course I didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u2019 he said from his home in South-West London. \u2018The man has dementia and should be left alone.\u2019 Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer\u2019s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK\u2019s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 in the defendant\u2019s absence to \u2018get to the bottom of the allegations\u2019.

Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'.

Or so says actress Patsy Kensit, who made the comments in an interview with this week's Stylist magazine. Miss Kensit, 47, appeared in the magazine's regular 'Queen of Everything' feature and said the Duchess of Cambridge would be her 'regal inspiration'. Feminist icon: Patsy Kensit says the Duchess of Cambridge is 'our generation's suffragette' Charity work: The Duchess is famous for philanthropy but not, until now, feminism She added: 'She's so fabulous on every level. She repeats outfits, which is brilliant. I know it's a shallow thing to say but I think it's done so much for women. 'I'm not going to be forced to have to look different every time I go out. She's like our generation's suffragette.' This is the first time that the Duchess, who spends much of her time doing charity work, has been lauded as a feminist icon. Although she has won plaudits for her dedication to children's charities such as The Art Room and Place2Be, her demure dress sense and closeness to her family has resulted in some criticism. Most recently, novelist Margaret Atwood revealed that she thinks Kate is an 'uneventful dresser' who is no match for Princess Diana. Suffragette: Emily Wilding Davison is pictured throwing herself in front of the King's horse in 1913 Votes for women: Campaigners lobbying for votes for women became known as suffragettes Critics: The Duchess was dubbed a 'machine made princess' by Hilary Mantel and 'drab' by Margaret Atwood \u2018I think she\u2019s watching her back,' continued the 75-year-old author.

In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society Laying out and living it up: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes showcase luxurious vacation spots It's just one big fiesta: A glance through the social media profile of a Mirrey often reveals a party picture Bling: Good clothes, nice watches and a flashy style are almost prerequisites for becoming one of the Mirreyes Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money:\u00a0Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages,\u00a0Maclean's\u00a0reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' L\u00f3pez got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the\u00a0daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'. Keeping time: People often post pictures of watches and other luxuries like designer bags and or alcohol Rought: In Mexico, the images of wealth are shocking as households take in an average of $12,850 per year Symbol: Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores (right), who likely died after jumping off a boat, is an example of a Mirrey Purchasing power: Mirreyes might not even think twice about spending hundreds of dollars on a stuffed bear Selfie star: L\u00f3pez, the son of\u00a0then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality,\u00a0Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a \u00a0a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors:\u00a0By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the\u00a0National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.'

There have been two small earthquakes in Lancashire since fracking began in the county in March, including the latest on Friday.In an analysis of the April quake published on its website the BGS said: Any process that injects pressurised water into rocks at depth will cause the rock to fracture and possibly produce earthquakes.It is well known that injection of water or other fluids during the oil extraction and geothermal engineering, such as Shale gas, processes can result in earthquake activity.The BGS said the April tremor took place 1.2 miles (2km) away from the drilling site but said its monitoring instruments were 50 miles (80km) away.Speaking about the latest quake, Dr Brian Baptie, head of seismology at the BGS, said: The earthquake was felt by at least one person in Poulton-Le-Fylde.Our analysis places the epicentre of the event to within 2km of the Preese Hall site.Data from two temporary instruments close to the drill site, installed after the magnitude 2.3 earthquake on 1 April, indicate that the event occurred at a depth of approximately 2km (1.2 miles).The recorded waveforms are very similar to those from the magnitude 2.3 event last month, which suggests that the two events share a similar location and mechanism.", "reference": "shale gas test drilling in lancashire has been suspended following an earthquake on the fylde coast.", "sentences": ["the uk\\'s oil and gas authority (nda) has confirmed it is investigating the discovery of a massive earthquake in the uk."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the uk's oil and gas authority (nda) has confirmed it is investigating the discovery of a massive earthquake in the uk.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript does not mention any UK oil and gas authority called 'NDA' or any investigation by such an authority, nor does it describe the tremor as 'massive' \u2013 instead it discusses BGS analysis and Cuadrilla suspending fracking after a 1.5 magnitude tremor.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

I suspect there are probably four, five or six nations that athletics has a problem with.Commission chairman Dick Pound said Russia's athletics federation, Araf, should be banned from the Rio 2016 Olympics.Warner told BBC Radio 5 live: Every other international sport today should be looking at Russian sport and looking at whether the men and women who compete in their events are clean.They do not have robust anti-doping regimes. They are asleep on the job - and they have to be rooted out.Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, also implicated the International Association of Athletics' Federations.The IAAF's former president Lamine Diack has been provisionally suspended by the International Olympic Committee, who have also asked the IAAF to start disciplinary action against the athletes named in the report.Araf has been told to respond to the report by Friday and Russia have defended their position.Acting head of Russia Athletics Federation, Vadim Zelichenok, said: There is an element of a political hit job here because quite a few things were described in the report in a biased way.Russia's sports ministry has said it will work more closely with Wada,Igor Zagorskiy, deputy director of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency, Rusada, told the BBC: There is always room for improvement.We are on that track and we've been on that track together with Wada. We will continue this work on this.Warner says the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), must be restructured to combat the problem.He revealed that he had spoken to IAAF president Lord Coe since Monday's publication of Wada's independent commission, which examined allegations of doping, cover-ups and extortion in Russian athletics, and also implicated the IAAF.The 323-page report said that acceptance of cheating at all levels is widespread in Russia and suggested that neither Araf, Rusada, nor the Russian Federation can be considered anti-doping code-compliant.The report also said the London 2012 Olympics were sabotaged by widespread inaction against athletes with suspicious doping profiles; accuses Moscow laboratory director Grigory Rodchenko of asking for and accepting bribes and intentionally destroying samples he was told to keep; and recommends that five Russian athletes and five coaches should be given lifetime doping bans.Media playback is not supported on this devicePound, who chaired the Wada investigation, said the situation was worse than we thought, adding that it may be a residue of the old Soviet Union system.Warner backed the recommendation to suspend Russia from competition until they put their house in order, adding: If you punish one or two innocent Russian athletes for the greater good of the sport, that is a moral dilemma I am willing to grasp.He also suggested that Russia is unlikely to be the only country guilty of doping, saying that athletics has probably got some other nations to root out.He added that while there are undoubtedly drugs cheats in many corners of athletics, he believed systemic doping did not occur in nations in the Western world.During a special BBC Radio 5 live programme examining the independent report, Britain's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe said: I don't think anyone is under the impression it's only Russia.On the same programme, former British sprinter Darren Campbell warned of darker days to come.He said: This report was about Russia, and they need to be punished if this holds up, but we'll lose sight on the bigger issues if we focus on Russia. It's about cleaning everything out.There's people talking about testing out in Kenya and Jamaica. We can't have rumours anymore.We need to understand how the Russians got away with it. How did this happen yet nobody knew?No matter how dark and depressing it gets, change has to happen now.Coe, elected IAAF president in August, described the Wada report as alarming and has said he will seek urgent approval from members to consider sanctions against the Russian federation.The report found evidence of multiple rules breaches by IAAF officials and found the governing body to be inexplicably lax in following up suspicious blood (and other) profiles.Media playback is not supported on this deviceIt has also been criticised for its handling of the allegations, with Coe himself describing claims about suspicious blood profiles involving some athletes as a declaration of war on my sport in August.On Monday, Coe said that if there are failings in our governance or our anti-doping programme I will fix them.But Warner says Coe needs to restructure the IAAF in order for it to effectively tackle the problem.This cannot be a one-man crusade, Warner told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He needs to ensure there is a bench around him at the IAAF who dramatically improve the operation.We all know, and he has already said, he needs to go out and hire a good chief executive.It needs more than that. He also possibly needs a chairman under him so he can take the lead of the elected council and be the ambassador for the sport and have full-time professional staff, possibly from outside sport, from elsewhere in business, who can get a grip on the organisation.", "reference": "russia is not the only country with systemic doping problems, says uk athletics chairman ed warner.", "sentences": ["the head of the world anti-doping agency (wada) says the country\\'s athletics governing body should be banned from athletics."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\":\"the head of the world anti-doping agency (wada) says the country\\'s athletics governing body should be banned from athletics.\",\"reason\":\"The summary misidentifies Dick Pound as the head of WADA when he was the chairman of its independent commission and it also changes the scope of the ban from being specific to the Rio 2016 Olympics to a general ban from all athletics.\",\"category\":\"entity error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months\u2019 notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith\u2019s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. \u2018If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn\u2019t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.\u2019 The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. \u2018But if he isn\u2019t compos mentis, there\u2019s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he\u2019s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? \u2018It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.\u2019 Janner\u2019s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children\u2019s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government\u2019s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. \u2018Of course I didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u2019 he said from his home in South-West London. \u2018The man has dementia and should be left alone.\u2019 Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer\u2019s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK\u2019s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision. Last week it was revealed she over-ruled an expert in child abuse cases by deciding not to charge Janner. Eleanor Laws QC recommended a \u2018trial of the facts\u2019 in the defendant\u2019s absence to \u2018get to the bottom of the allegations\u2019. A CPS spokesman said: \u2018It is the DPP\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what the DPP has done.\u2019", "reference": "lord janner told the lords he wanted to remain a peer earlier this month . a week later the cps ruled that he was unfit to face child sex charges . janner escaped prosecution over allegations because he has alzheimer 's . but he was apparently well enough to sign his name in a note to the lords .", "sentences": ["lord janner signed letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges .", "janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has alzheimer 's disease .", "the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in april 9 note to lords authorities ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"lord janner signed letter saying he wanted to remain a peer just a week before he was ruled unfit to face child sex charges .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This aligns exactly with the transcript's opening statement that he signed such a letter a week before being ruled unfit for trial.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has alzheimer 's disease .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states the CPS decided not to prosecute him on those grounds due to his Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in april 9 note to lords authorities .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This matches the transcript's claim that he was well enough to sign the April 9 note to Lords authorities.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said. 'Entrusting it all to Dominic Winter and Co has taken away much of the pain, and through them I wish anyone who comes to possess anything that was mine as much joy and pleasure as it has given me through the years.'

He was also consulted as an expert during the raising of the Tudor shipwreck the Mary Rose. Mr Hardy, a close friend of Richard Burton, worked with top actors including Laurence Olivier, John Gielgud and Judi Dench during his early days as a Shakespearean specialist. He found national fame playing vet Siegfried Farnon in All Creatures Great and Small, the hit BBC drama which aired between 1978 and 1990 and also starred Lynda Bellingham.

The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be\u00a0Deir ez-Zo in Syria Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya.

Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.' Wasp numbers saw a steady decline and then a sharp rise in the past few years (left) but there has been a clear rise in the number of bed bugs across the country (right) The number of ant infestations reported has shot up three-fold in Scotland in the last five years, data showed, with those in Fife most likely to report a problem", "reference": "birmingham had almost 15,000 call outs for rats , more than any other city . newcastle residents were most likely to report pest problem last year . the most pest-free place was southend , in essex , according to survey . british pest control association warns number of bugs at an all-time high .", "sentences": ["the midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014 .", "newcastle is the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 % of those living on tyneside reporting problems with rats , cockroaches , wasps and other creepy crawlies .", "five per cent of residents in newcastle , more than 6,000 people , called in pest inspectors last year ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "NoE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"the midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014 .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"This is verbatim from the transcript, which states that the Midlands city had almost 15,000 rat exterminations between 2013 and 2014.\",  \n    \"category\": \"no error\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"newcastle is the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 % of those living on tyneside reporting problems with rats , cockroaches , wasps and other creepy crawlies .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"This matches the transcript, which explicitly calls Newcastle the most pest-infested place with 5% of Tyneside residents reporting such problems.\",  \n    \"category\": \"no error\"  \n  },  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"five per cent of residents in newcastle , more than 6,000 people , called in pest inspectors last year .\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that 5% of Newcastle residents, over 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year.\",  \n    \"category\": \"no error\"  \n  }  \n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

{"doc_id": "37838086", "source": "bbc", "split": "valid", "model": "TranS2S", "transcript": "Share this withEmailFacebookMessengerMessengerTwitterPinterestWhatsAppLinkedInCopy this linkAfter weeks of speculation about whether the Governor of the Bank of England would extend his time as its head in reaction to the referendum result, Mark Carney surprised many people in the City and in government by announcing a decision that few had considered.Although many officials at the Bank believed that Mark Carney had two options before him - stay until 2021 or leave as originally intended in 2018 - the governor proffered a third.Extend, yes, but for just one more year.Superficially, it appeared to be a rather awkward fudge.Did Mr Carney feel under political pressure not to extend until 2021 despite wanting to?Was he so disillusioned by the gloomy economic predictions for the UK that he would rather not stick around to see the full effects of the Brexit vote?Or was there another issue weighing on his mind: how his family would feel about another three years in the UK with a father who is regularly away at some global summit or other one weekend in every two?The third, it appears, was the clincher.When Mr Carney took office in 2013, the notion that Britain would be beginning the difficult process of negotiating its way out of the European Union three years later (a process described by the former head of the World Trade Organisation, Pascal Lamy, as something akin to taking an egg out of omelette), was a remote one.But that all changed on 23 June.Beyond trying to stabilise the economy, it also created a personal issue for the Governor.If he left in 2018 as originally agreed, it would be right in the middle of Britain's exit negotiations.Should he, therefore, extend his term to the full eight years that governors would usually be expected to serve?That might provide a greater level of certainty for jittery markets.And the Governor certainly understood the challenge of the job had changed, telling those close to him that an extension was an option and he wanted to serve - discussions which led to predictions in the media he would serve the full eight years.But, a number of weeks ago in far more private discussions, he started talking about a third way - the short extension.The reasons were personal and unique.In 2018, one of Mr Carney's four daughters will be finishing her A-levels, and another will be completing her GCSEs.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can.For his family, this was the perfect moment to return home to Canada and its much lauded education system.He hinted at how important that was in evidence to the economic affairs committee of the House of Lords last week.To be absolutely clear, it is an entirely personal decision, he said about whether he would extend his stay.No one should read anything into that decision as regards government policy - actual, imagined, potential, past. It is an absolute privilege for me to have this role. I fully recognise that.Like everyone, I have personal circumstances that I have to manage. This is a role that requires total attention and devotion. I intend to give that for as long as I can. Those are the only factors.Those around Mr Carney dismiss any notion of tension with the Prime Minister, who was certainly keen for the Governor to extend his period in office to 2021. However, Theresa May was clear that it was up to Mr Carney to make the decision.Neither did criticism from those who believe the Bank's pre-referendum economic forecasts were too gloomy about the effects of a Brexit vote get under his skin, they add.Professionally, Mr Carney was clear that it would difficult to leave in the teeth of the Brexit negotiations.But, with his family leaving in 2018 as originally planned, he only felt able to extend his time in the UK by one year.By then the Article 50 process of decoupling Britain from the EU should be complete.

Later in the clip the dog creeps up behind the reptile but remains twitchy and nervous as it prepares to run away at any minute. According to the video maker, who is believed to live in Canada, the pair completely love one another. The filmmaker can then be heard laughing as the bearded dragon  chases the dog around the coffee table She wrote in the comment section of the original video: \u2018They seriously love to play together. I love to watch them. \u2018Our Chihuahua never tries to hurt the dragon, she really loves to chase him and our dragon gets excited whenever she comes into the room because he thinks it's time to play.

The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be\u00a0Deir ez-Zo in Syria Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya. Fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have been on the offensive and a large area is now divided between Kurdish and IS control.

Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla. 'My progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up.' Scroll down for video Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.' Barely-there biceps: In October 2013, pictured, Aliesha had only just started going to the gym to help her improve her depression Welcome to the gun show: Pictured this month, Aliesha's arms have grown much more muscular; she says she now loves going to the gym Of course, Aliesha added, it isn't always easy to maintain the motivation to work out five to seven days a week, but sticking to a routine has helped. 'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded. 'My friends and family have all noticed the difference, my relationships are stronger, I feel better about myself, and I'm constantly striving for self improvement.'", "reference": "aliesha peterson , 22 , from canada , says a therapist recommended she start exercising to improve her depression . she writes on reddit that after ` slow ' progress for 20 months , she now sees an improvement in her mood and her body .", "sentences": ["aliesha peterson , 22 , detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the alberta , canada , resident to gain a noticeably fitter , and much more muscular , physique , as well as an impressive six-pack .", "aliesha 's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"aliesha peterson , 22 , detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the alberta , canada , resident to gain a noticeably fitter , and much more muscular , physique , as well as an impressive six-pack .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This accurately reflects the transcript, which states that Aliesha Peterson, 22, described how her routine took her from 145lbs to 127lbs and gave her a fitter, more muscular physique with a six-pack.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"aliesha 's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This matches the transcript statement that her workout routine focuses on a different body part each day of the week.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error"]}

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The bad old days of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of fans have thankfully been left far behind us now.

Developed by a U.S. dermatologist, it is said to be the first over-the-counter sunscreen that is 'physician strength'. EXPERT VERDICT: 'Titanium oxide reflects UVA and UVB rays off the skin, while oxtinoxate absorbs UV rays and converts them to heat, so it doesn't damage DNA - most good suncreams should contain these. 'Physician strength' sounds impressive, but I'm not sure what it means. 'Organic red tea might help mop up the harmful molecules produced as a result of UV exposure.

EXPERT VERDICT: 'This is easily absorbed and free of parabens (preservatives) and fragrance so would be good for a baby's sensitive skin as it won't cause irritation. 'Children are more likely to burn as their skin is still developing. 'Avocado oil is a good moisturiser, but it's not clear how it 'aids the development of the cutaneous barrier'. 'I'd say there are cheaper products that would work as well.' 7/10 Actinica Lotion \u00a319.99 for 80g, larger branches of Superdrug and Lloyds Pharmacies and pharmacy2u.co.uk CLAIMS: For the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer in at-risk patients (e.g. those who have a suppressed immune system, such as transplant patients). Protects against UVA and UVB. No SPF listed. EXPERT VERDICT: 'This product was tested for two years on immuno-suppressed patients who are at high risk of non-melanoma skin cancers, because they take drugs which suppress the body's defence cells which also destroy early cancer cells. 'Patients who've already had non-melanoma skin cancers might find it reassuring to use.' 8/10 Wilko Moisturising Sun Lotion SPF 50 \u00a32 for 50ml, from Wilko stores CLAIMS: A UVA and UVB sunscreen.

EXPERT VERDICT:\u00a0'All Factor 50 suncreams with UVA and UVB protection should protect against photo damage and sun spots. 'Hyaluronic acid is used as an anti-ageing treatment to restore lost volume in the skin, but there's limited evidence it has the same effect in a cream.

One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors.One employee wrote on Facebook: Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital.Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month.But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks.If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months.In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks.The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control.TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building.More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead.The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies.Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to avenge the blood of our people.IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks.In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people.Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.", "reference": "more than 30 people have been killed after attackers dressed as doctors stormed the largest military hospital in kabul, afghan officials say.", "sentences": ["taliban militants have attacked a hospital in the afghan capital, kabul, killing at least 14 people, officials say."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "{\"sentence\": \"taliban militants have attacked a hospital in the afghan capital, kabul, killing at least 14 people, officials say.\", \"reason\": \"The transcript states the attackers were Islamic State militants (not the Taliban) and does not mention a death toll of at least 14 people.\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

The next time he spoke with him, more than two months had passed and the younger Jordan was on a German-flagged container ship 200 miles from North Carolina, just rescued from his disabled boat. I thought I lost you, the relieved father said. Louis Jordan, 37, took his 35-foot sailboat out in late January and hadn't been heard from in 66 days when he was spotted Thursday afternoon by the Houston Express on his ship drifting in the Atlantic Ocean. I was utterly thankful and grateful to the people who rescued me, and I was grateful to God that my parents were not going to be worried about me, Jordan told CNN. Frank Jordan told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that he had worried about his son, who is an inexperienced sailor, but he held hope because his son had a good boat. And he had the strength to make it. He's got very strong constitution and (is strong) not only physically, but spiritually, Frank Jordan told CNN. And he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time, so I believe that sustained him a great deal. The younger Jordan said he took his sailboat out to the Gulf Stream to find some better fishing, when it capsized.  He broke his shoulder when the boat flipped. Because of the injury, Jordan couldn't repair the boat's mast, which had snapped. Everything I owned got broken -- all my electronics, my GPS devices, Jordan said.  He was dead in the water. Jordan drifted in the Atlantic, rationing food and water until his shoulder healed. He was able to rig a makeshift mast and sail, Jordan said, but he could make little headway against the currents. It took so long, he said.  It moved so slowly. The boat capsized two more times before he was rescued, according to Jordan. After his food and water ran out, it became an issue of survival. Collecting fresh water was a nightmare for Jordan.  The weather wouldn't cooperate. I had tried to collect (rain)water ... but every time the waves would splash into the boat, Jordan said.  The waves would put saltwater into my freshwater and it tasted bad. Finally the conditions were right.  I filled up my water tank, which is 25 gallons.  I filled up a bucket. Then there was the issue of food. The fish weren't cooperating, but after a while Jordan learned that they were attracted to his laundry that he would put out to sea for a rinse. The fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net, he said. Jodran came ashore Thursday evening. CNN affiliate WAVY in Norfolk, Virginia, reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into Sentara Norfolk General Hospital at about 7:30 p.m. Jordan was reported missing January 29, a few days after his last contact with his father. Two months of concern poured out in a phone call with his son's rescuers. Frank Jordan thanked the captain of the Houston Express. You're a good man, I swear.  You did what you are supposed to do, and I sure do appreciate it, he says. And I know my son appreciates it.

However, the shooter had instead taken some three dozen police officers on a wild chase back into D.C. that ended when officers shot him on a busy Northeast Washington street.

Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C.

Summer Robertson from Shrewsbury died after being overpowered by fierce currents off a picturesque beach in December near Kenton-on-Sea, a small town on the country's south-eastern coast. Miss Robertson was with three other British members of a team that had completed a 10-week charity adventure together with the Latitude youth volunteering group, at a remote camping resort. Summer Robertson, 21, who died after drowning off the coast of South Africa, where she had been helping youngsters in one of the country's poorest townships Miss Robertson's parents Sarah and John have been remembering their daughter who they described as a 'bubbly tomboy' But she soon got into difficulties in the water and died before she was brought to shore. Another volunteer, 19-year-old Alice Barnett, from Canterbury in Kent also passed away after her body was washed up on the beach a day later. Now four months after the incident, her parents John and Sarah, who also have two sons Michael and Sam, have been remembering their daughter, who died while on a trip of a lifetime working with deprived youngsters. Her father Mr Robertson, a 51-year-old works foreman, said he spoke to his daughter on the day she died. He explained: 'I spoke to her that Thursday morning. Summer pictured volunteering in South Africa. The 21-year-old had spoken to her father John just hours before she had died Miss Robertson, left, died alongside fellow volunteer Alice Barnett, right, after they went for a celebratory swim after finishing their volunteering course 'She said everything was great, they had finished their work and were having a few days relaxing before they came home. 'I was due to pick her up on the Tuesday. She contacted us at least once a week and said she was living the dream.' Her mother says she had no worries about her daughter taking part in the trip, but Mr Robertson added he did warn her to stay out of the sea, as she was not a confident swimmer. He added: 'She was only paddling in shallow waters. It's just horribly sad. 'On the night of her death, two policemen came to the door at 11.30, and I knew straight away. 'I knew it was either Summer or our son Sam, who was living in digs in Birmingham at the time while at university. 'As soon as they said Summer's name, I knew something had happened.'

More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the most severe public health emergency seen in modern times showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities.

he said.What have we done wrong? added GB Badminton's performance director Jon Austin.Judo, which was given the same target as badminton and also claimed one bronze medal, has had its funding increased slightly.Liz Nicholl, CEO of UK Sport, said the decision to cut funding was not taken lightly.We would like to invest in every sport but the reality is we have to prioritise to protect and enhance the medal potential, she said.If we under-invest across the board then the British teams will ultimately underperform at the Games and medal success will be put at risk.Sports minister Tracey Crouch added: UK Sport's approach to elite sport has proven successful in Beijing, London and Rio and the ambition to win more medals in Tokyo is a bold one that, if achieved, would mean a sensational summer of sport in 2020.Basketball had its funding withdrawn in 2014 - and handball and volleyball lost theirs in 2012 - but say a UK Sport review last year to build performance pathways for future success was supposed to be aimed at such sports.A British Basketball statement, in conjunction with volleyball and handball, said: It appears that UK Sport has no interest in team sports and in particular refuses to take responsibility for the need to fund their performance development, which was identified in its own review.With UK Sport's investment budget approaching \u00a3350m, it borders on intransigence to pass responsibility to government and other funding bodies who are not set up to fund the development of high-performance sport.UK Sport says investment in the five Olympic sports and two Paralympic sports added for Tokyo 2020 is yet to be confirmed.Baseball/softball will return to the programme, with karate, skateboard, sports climbing and surfing also added, while Para-taekwondo and Para-badminton join the Paralympic programme.UK Sport says funding will be determined following further exploration of medal potential, with \u00a39m of the \u00a3345m total still to be allocated.Liam Carroll, head coach of the GB baseball team, said: The key to unlocking our potential is investment and I'm pleased that UK Sport has left the door open.We look forward to the opportunity to impress upon them that getting behind Great Britain Baseball can extend their tremendous track record of investing in Olympic medal contenders.", "reference": "badminton is one of five sports to lose all uk sport funding for the 2020 olympics in tokyo-after britain claimed a bronze in the sport in rio.", "sentences": ["great britain\\'s badminton england team has been forced to withdraw from the rio olympics after failing to qualify for the rio olympics."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"great britain's badminton england team has been forced to withdraw from the rio olympics after failing to qualify for the rio olympics.\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Badminton England\u2019s athletes not only qualified but also won a bronze medal in Rio; there is no mention of a withdrawal or failure to qualify.\",  \n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"  \n  }  \n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

I followed the Irish rider Felix English and I had a good lead out.Elsewhere Britain's sole rider in the men's keirin, Joe Truman, was outclassed in his semi-final, having tried to take the race out with two laps to go.And in the women's team pursuit, GB finished fifth in the heats and failed to make the bronze-medal ride.Olympic gold medallist Chris BoardmanLatham had a fantastic final charge. He timed his effort well there.We hardly saw him in the race, he monitored things but that's why. He was waiting for that final sprint. And what a ride that was for him.But with three laps to go, I would not have said that Teklinski would make it, but he found something from somewhere to just hang on there.More than 2km out, he effectively started to sprint. It will take him some time to recover from that.Six-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Chris HoyI don't think that would be expected. It's the kind of event you can never be super-confident of winning or winning a medal in.But if you ride sensibly, which he did, he positioned himself very well and didn't waste any energy in the first part of the race.He marked the danger men and clearly had the legs for the sprint at the end. That's fantastic, a really great result for him and the team.Team pursuit Olympic gold medallist Elinor Barker came into the quartet of Emily Nelson, Manon Lloyd and Ellie Dickinson.The young squad were unable to compete for a medal but Barker remained positive about their progress.She told the BBC: It's the first Worlds for all of these girls and it's made it a lot more exciting.The level is so high already physically and technically. We have so much scope for improvement. It's such a good place to be in.Four years until Tokyo and we've just come fifth at the Worlds.Double Olympic gold medallist Joanna Rowsell Shand said on BBC TV: Coming into the competition, I don't think anyone expected them to medal.Until Elinor Barker joined the team today, we had four brand new riders. With an average age of 19, they've all got bright futures ahead of them.Earlier in the day, Olympic bronze medallist Katy Marchant was eliminated from the women's sprint in the first round.The 24-year-old, who claimed bronze behind Kristina Vogel of Germany and fellow Briton Becky James at Rio 2016, was the only female sprinter to travel to Hong Kong.The former heptathlete qualified in 16th place but was ousted by 17th-fastest Lin Junhong of China earlier on Thursday.Marchant is scheduled to compete in two more events - Saturday's 500m time-trial and Sunday's keirin.I'm really disappointed. I feel like I'm just missing a little bit of zing, which is something that coming off Rio is to be expected, she said.I didn't get the roar when I got the number on my back today - maybe the fact it's not an Olympic Games or something in the back of my mind telling me that I'm not feeling great.I know to get knocked out in the first round is not what we expect from a medallist, but the preparation coming into this competition is about the process leading on to Tokyo.Media playback is not supported on this device", "reference": "great britain\\'s chris latham won a bronze medal in the men\\'s scratch race at the track world championships.", "sentences": ["britain\\'s laura latham won a bronze medal at the track cycling world championships in the czech republic in rio."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\":\"britain's laura latham won a bronze medal at the track cycling world championships in the czech republic in rio.\",\"reason\":\"The transcript describes a male rider surnamed Latham taking bronze at the Hong Kong championships, whereas the summary invents a first name (Laura), mislabels the event as the world championships, and changes the location to the Czech Republic and Rio\u2014none of which appear in the transcript.\",\"category\":\"out-of-context error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Electoral Commission rules state food and entertainment cannot be provided by parliamentary candidates if their provision is intended to influence votes - a criminal offence known as 'treating'.

His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory \u2013 or a loss \u2013 could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role, he said.He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interviewBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah CampbellThe recent headlines about William being a work shy prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.He accepts that he will be criticised but it's not something I take completely to heart.An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was the best role model I could have in front of me.Full details of Queen's birthday celebrationsTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.Republic said the Queen's birthday does not warrant this kind of coverage and that the BBC had a duty to report, not to celebrate the royals.Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had failed completely to report the birthday in a way that was fair, balanced and proportionate.", "reference": "prince william has answered criticism of his commitment to royal duties, saying he is willing to take on more responsibility when the time comes.", "sentences": ["prince william has said the queen is  on a glimpse of the queen\\'s commitment  to making the queen\\'s 90th birthday."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"prince william has said the queen is on a glimpse of the queen's commitment to making the queen's 90th birthday.\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The sentence is ungrammatical and unclear, failing to convey any meaningful relation to the transcript.\",  \n    \"category\": \"grammatical error\"  \n  }  \n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["grammatical error"]}

Edin Dzeko and his Manchester City team-mates reflect on their Premier League defeat at Crystal Palace Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany looks dejected after seeing his side slump to defeat in London However, after being sent on their way from the Etihad Stadium at 1.30pm by City legend Mike Summerbee, all of those onboard the six coaches missed the kick-off with some arriving as much as 20 minutes after the start. Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival. Now, the club has acknowledged the coaches set off too late and have written to supporters to apologise and advise them that they will be refunding the cost of their match tickets. The letter, seen by Sportsmail, reads: 'The free coach travel was provided to enable supporters to attend this match on a day when return rail travel from Manchester wasn\u2019t an option due to the kick-off time, and the time of the final train back to Manchester.

'As a gesture to you and all supporters who travelled on the official coaches, the club will be refunding the money that you paid for your match ticket within the next seven working days. We will contact you if we require any further details to process the refund. 'We would like to apologise for the delayed arrival at Selhurst Park and thank you for your patience and support on the day.' The move is likely to cost the club in the region of \u00a312,000.

Herrera netted a brace against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon without actually looking at Brad Guzan's goal as his eyes appeared to be shut when making contact with the ball. In fact, six of Herrera's seven goals have been scored without him even having to glimpse at either the ball or the opposition's net.

if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven.Temasek's investment in Olam means that the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze, the report says.Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.The fund told the BBC: Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address.As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record.It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations.Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible.Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas.The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations, bringing the same practices to Africa that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia.In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent.We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done, it said.Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.", "reference": "palm oil giant olam has been accused of using suppliers that may use unsustainable practices in parts of southeast asia.", "sentences": ["one of indonesia\\'s largest suppliers of palm oil, olamme, has been accused of deliberately deliberately using palm oil to burn crops in indonesia."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[  \n  {  \n    \"sentence\": \"one of indonesia's largest suppliers of palm oil, olamme, has been accused of deliberately deliberately using palm oil to burn crops in indonesia.\",  \n    \"reason\": \"The summary misstates both Olam\u2019s role\u2014Olam is not one of Indonesia\u2019s largest suppliers of palm oil\u2014and incorrectly claims it was accused of \u2018deliberately using palm oil to burn crops\u2019, which does not appear in the transcript.

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act.
