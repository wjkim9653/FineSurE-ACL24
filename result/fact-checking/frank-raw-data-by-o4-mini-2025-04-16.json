It set up its factories in Mumbai in western Maharashtra and Khambhat (also known as Cambay) in Gujarat state, and continued to trade in matchboxes until after World War Two.The company exported its matchboxes to Arab countries. Ambarnath, written in Hindi on this label, was the location of the first Wimco factory in western Maharashtra state. Very few Wimco labels used Indian languages and they did not last long. This rather drab label featuring the dhow is not one of their common brands.This label promoted the Swadeshi (self-reliance) movement during the partition of India's Bengal region in 1905. A number of Indian labels started during the independence struggle after calls were made to boycott British goods. Most firms used Indian languages to add nationalist fervour to their brands. Labels from the 1920s and 30s tell the story of India's struggle for freedom. Some labels even celebrated important personalities associated with the freedom movement.It's believed that this matchbox was commissioned by the royal family of Bhavnagar in western Gujarat state for their personal use during British rule. Little is known about such matchboxes because records were not kept at the time and little research is possible today.Many Bollywood films were promoted on matchboxes in the 1950s.

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.", "reference": "manchester city were beaten 4-2 by manchester united at old trafford . defeat leaves city fourth in premier league , four points behind man united . man city desperately need to strengthen an ageing squad in the summer . and it remains to be see whether city will stick with manuel pellegrini . but the biggest challenge could be keeping hold of sergio aguero . argentine scored a brace against united to take his tally for city to 100 .", "sentences": ["manchester city striker sergio aguero looks as outdated as a commodore 64 .", "but the argentine 's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration .", "aguero is settled in manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last august ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["LinkE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"manchester city striker sergio aguero looks as outdated as a commodore 64 .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says the 'blue machine' (the team) looks outdated as a Commodore 64, not Aguero himself, so the entity attribution is incorrect.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but the argentine 's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This matches the transcript's statement that Aguero's achievement of 100 goals in 158 appearances deserves recognition and celebration.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"aguero is settled in manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last august .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a five-year deal last August, exactly as summarized.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "no error", "no error"]}

The country is due to repay a \u00a3330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list.

But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'", "reference": "douglas bader recovered from having both legs amputated to become one of britain 's greatest fighter aces . was shot down over france in 1941 and ended up in german prison camp . and he was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in the great escape . now , hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian mark felton 's book about the escape into a blockbuster .", "sentences": ["douglas bader 's story is to be told in a hollywood film being dubbed ` the first great escape ' the officer was shot down over france in august 1941 and ended up in a german prison camp in warburg .", "it was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 in the great escape .", "bader 's life story has been told on the warburg escape by historian mark felton ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "GramE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"douglas bader 's story is to be told in a hollywood film being dubbed ` the first great escape ' the officer was shot down over france in august 1941 and ended up in a german prison camp in warburg .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This matches the transcript which states that Douglas Bader's story will be told in a Hollywood film called \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019 and that he was shot down over France in August 1941, ending up in a German prison camp at Warburg.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"it was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 in the great escape .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The pronoun \u201cit\u201d has no clear antecedent in the summary, whereas the transcript specifies that the officer (Bader) was involved in the breakout; using \u201cit\u201d is a coreference error.\",\n    \"category\": \"coreference error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"bader 's life story has been told on the warburg escape by historian mark felton .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says that Mark Felton wrote a book on the Warburg escape, not that he told Bader\u2019s entire life story; this misstates the predicate relationship.\",\n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "coreference error", "predicate error"]}

Speaking in the latest issue of\u00a0Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, the 54-year-old, who stars as fictional US President Selina Meyer in the hit comedy show, was quick to note the scrutiny the former\u00a0senator\u00a0and secretary of state has faced as a result of her varying hairstyles over the years, while also leaping to the politician's defense. 'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine Short and sweet:\u00a0Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose\u00a0ideology\u00a0revolves around getting 're-elected at all\u00a0costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female\u00a0politicians\u00a0get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There\u2019s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let\u2019s do something about that,' she said. 'Let\u2019s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that\u2019s OK, and if it does look good, that\u2019s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld.

Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture. Colombian goalkeeper David Ospina selected a rap song from his home country - J Balvin's 'Tranquila' Theo Walcott opted for a 1996 summer jam - LL Cool J's laid back R&B song 'Loungin''", "reference": "arsenal face burnley in evening fixture at turf moor on saturday . gunners are 2nd in the premier league while hosts are in relegation zone . arsenal partner europcar reveal playlist players will listen to on the bus . olivier giroud picks coldplay , danny welbeck opts for chase and status . theo walcott is an ll cool j fan , nacho monreal goes for david guetta . read : arsenal stars in good spirits as they bid to win eighth straight game .", "sentences": ["Arsenal travel to Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday evening .", "Gunners players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist .", "Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay 's ` Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall ' Santi Cazorla chose Spanish pop star Melendi 's slow track ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "EntE", "RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Arsenal travel to Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday evening .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that the Gunners are preparing for a Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday and mentions a Saturday evening fixture, so this is accurate.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Gunners players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly says that Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their tie with Burnley.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay 's ` Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall ' Santi Cazorla chose Spanish pop star Melendi 's slow track .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms that Giroud chose Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' and that Cazorla opted for a slow Melendi track.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

However Tevez has thrown cold water over the 'chicken dance' interpretation by telling Sky Sport Italia: 'That game [against River] does not come into it.

{"doc_id": "33717488", "source": "bbc", "split": "test", "model": "PtGen", "transcript": "At the start of each month Elena, a 40-year-old Muscovite, spreads all the family cash on the table and starts dividing it into small piles.When I do this I shake, I feel nauseous, she says.This goes to one bank, that to another, then the third one\u2026 There's one more bank, but we don't have the money for them - I had to go and buy some food. I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to those four banks.After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job.Millions of those in debt live like Elena.According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages.By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months.The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (\u00a310.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks.For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones.It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions.We were a bit stupid, Elena says. They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about.Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict.The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles.Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals. Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says.Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October.Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead.Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution.A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and this year it's probably going to be around 16%.He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow.Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents.His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance.And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage. The bank is suing and they may well lose their only dwelling.There must be a normal way out - maybe give the bank a fixed share of my wages? Vladimir wonders. But so far he has not found anyone at the bank to discuss his dilemma.Isn't there a law against this? asks his father, equally helplessly. How can they let people borrow so much without checking them first?After the good years many Russians are now getting a harsh lesson in capitalism - and inadequate regulations mean there is nothing to soften the blow.", "reference": "millions of russians took out loans during the economic boom years, but now they face crippling debts and the law is not on their side, the bbc\\'s oleg boldyrev reports.", "sentences": ["it\\'s hard to walk out of the world\\'s most specialised banks-elena and elena-and why do you have ever seen."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "OutE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\n  \"sentence\": \"it\u2019s hard to walk out of the world\u2019s most specialised banks-elena and elena-and why do you have ever seen.\",\n  \"reason\": \"The sentence is incoherent and ungrammatical, bearing no relation to any factual content in the transcript and lacking clear meaning.\",\n  \"category\": \"grammatical error\"\n}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["grammatical error"]}
