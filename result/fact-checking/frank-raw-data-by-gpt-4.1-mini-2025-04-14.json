Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (there is no alternative).What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.", "reference": "i have n\\'t been in greece for three weeks but i am told it is eerily quiet and-in respect of tourism-surprisingly busy.", "sentences": ["more than two million greek banks have been affected by the collapse of the international monetary fund ( imf ) this week."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\": \"more than two million greek banks have been affected by the collapse of the international monetary fund ( imf ) this week.\", \"reason\": \"The transcript does not mention any collapse of the IMF or that Greek banks have been affected in such a manner; it only mentions the partial closure of Greek banks and economic difficulties, not a collapse of the IMF or millions of banks affected.\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

That was a courageous and correct decision and an important step.And retired defender Arne Friedrich, who played with Hitzlsperger at Euro 2008, wrote: Proud of you Thomas.

I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay].The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality.German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public.It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him, Seibert told a media briefing.We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance.We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger.Openly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same.I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo, he said. It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same].And Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football.He said: I'm confident that sexual orientations will soon not be an issue in football at all.", "reference": "german football has rallied around thomas hitzlsperger after the former international midfielder revealed he was gay.", "sentences": ["former german footballer lukas hitzlsperger has announced his retirement from international football."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\": \"former german footballer lukas hitzlsperger has announced his retirement from international football.\", \"reason\": \"The transcript does not mention Lukas Hitzlsperger announcing his retirement from international football; it discusses his coming out as homosexual and the reactions to it.\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: Has she got a baby in her belly?' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her.

The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson \u2013 revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007. 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer\u00a0in December. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments.

When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.' In the wake of the Enquirer's revelation, Poodle posted a text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly told him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.'

Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that\u00a025 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo \u00a0claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from\u00a0Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven.
