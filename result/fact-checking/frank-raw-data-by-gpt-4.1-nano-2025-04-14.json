What exactly is service of process? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go off the grid. Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is nail and mail service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of service is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, traditional doesn't necessarily mean good.  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be liked by all your gawking friends, we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we live in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.", "reference": "a court allowed a wife to serve divorce papers via facebook . danny cevallos : why not let people be found via social media ? .", "sentences": ["serving people with legal papers is `` service of process '' in new york .", "judge : if you are going to sue , you should know about it .", "he says it 's an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "EntE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "RelE", "GramE", "CorefE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"serving people with legal papers is `` service of process '' in new york .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explains that service of process is the legal method of notifying someone of a lawsuit, but it does not specify that this is specific to New York or that serving legal papers is called 'service of process' in New York.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"judge : if you are going to sue , you should know about it .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that the guiding principle of service of process is that a person should be notified if they are sued, but it does not quote or specify a particular judge's statement as a direct quote.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"he says it 's an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript mentions a New York judge issuing an opinion about service of divorce papers on a husband via Facebook, but the summary's phrasing simplifies and generalizes this as an 'opinion authorizing service,' which is not explicitly stated in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "out-of-context error", "predicate error"]}

The viral clip shows the 23-year-old defender lifting the ball into the net to the sound of gasps from his team mates at the Catalonia club. Joking  that he could do the same with his mum and grandmother, nine-year-old Frankie, who is an academy player with Dagenham and Redbridge Football Club, took to the garden to have a go. He moved the basketball hoop into the middle of the goal and after a little run up sent the ball straight through the net first time. In the video he can be seen turning to face the camera looking absolutely gob-smacked as he places his hands behind his head. A slow motion look at the clip captures the trajectory of the ball, which bounces off the backboard and goes through the hoop below.

Vettel responded: You didn't. You were lucky this time. Kvyat shrugged: I'm on the podium; you're on the podium.In the post-race interviews, Kvyat added: You see the gap, you go for it on the inside. You see one car it is hard to see both. It was a risky move, I agree with Seb but you have to take risks and I am on the podium.Listen to Vettel's post-race rantAt the front, Ricciardo had made a stunning start to take the lead from pole-sitter Rosberg at the first corner.In the process his left-rear wheel had been tagged by Rosberg's front wing. Whether it was that or the debris on the track, Ricciardo suffered a left-rear puncture on lap three, allowing the Mercedes to pass.Ricciardo would almost certainly not have been able to hold off Rosberg in any case, but his removal from the lead left the German serene out front.Mercedes decided not to stop him under the safety car and when the race re-started on lap nine, Rosberg simply drove off into the distance.Listen to the first-lap madnessHamilton, meanwhile, was in the wars. Mercedes stopped him twice under the safety car, doing only one lap on the super-soft tyres in an attempt to ensure he could use only the softs for the rest of the race.So Hamilton had done three stops within the first six laps and he was lying third from last at the restart.He began his fightback from there, with the Ferraris doing the same - Vettel starting from 11th and Raikkonen not far behind Hamilton, who said his progress had been affected by damage to the car in the incident with Nasr.The car was pretty damaged, said the 31-year-old afterwards. I'm sure it was some aero components but I think it was the suspension as well because it was flexing all over the place.Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said the front wing had damaged the leading edge of the floor and the barge boards when it came off and that the car had lost a lot of aerodynamic performance.After a further switch to the medium compound tyres to last the race, Hamilton was not able to recover as much ground as the Ferraris and faces an uphill battle if he is to stop Rosberg winning his first world title this year.Chinese Grand Prix race resultsChinese Grand Prix coverage details", "reference": "nico rosberg took his third straight win of 2016 as mercedes team-mate lewis hamilton fought back to seventh in a hectic chinese grand prix.", "sentences": ["nico rosberg beat mercedes team-mate lewis hamilton in the first practice session for the first formula 1 race of the season."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"nico rosberg beat mercedes team-mate lewis hamilton in the first practice session for the first formula 1 race of the season.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript discusses race incidents and results, but does not mention practice sessions or Rosberg beating Hamilton in the first practice session.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper. The pile on the in-tray on chairman Khaldoon al Mubarak's desk seems to be getting taller every week. It is essential that keeping Aguero is top of that ever-growing list or else that ageing blue machine risks heading for an even bigger crash.", "reference": "manchester city were beaten 4-2 by manchester united at old trafford . defeat leaves city fourth in premier league , four points behind man united . man city desperately need to strengthen an ageing squad in the summer . and it remains to be see whether city will stick with manuel pellegrini . but the biggest challenge could be keeping hold of sergio aguero . argentine scored a brace against united to take his tally for city to 100 .", "sentences": ["sergio aguero scored his 100th goal for manchester city in the 88th minute .", "the argentine has now scored 100 goals in just 158 appearances for city .", "aguero is settled in manchester and signed a new five-year deal last august .", "if the unthinkable happens and city slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the champions league stage ? ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"sergio aguero scored his 100th goal for manchester city in the 88th minute .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states Aguero scored his 100th goal in the 89th minute, not the 88th.\",\n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the argentine has now scored 100 goals in just 158 appearances for city .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This matches the information in the transcript about Aguero's 100 goals in 158 appearances.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"aguero is settled in manchester and signed a new five-year deal last august .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms Aguero signed a new five-year deal last August and is settled in Manchester.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"if the unthinkable happens and city slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the champions league stage ? .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript discusses Aguero's potential dissatisfaction if City do not qualify for the Champions League, aligning with this statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women around four months\u2019 extra life. The drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by European regulators. Patients will have access via the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until it is considered for routine NHS use. It has been available in England via the CDF since last March pending licensing. Scroll down for video Drug: Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women about four months\u2019 extra life Each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from Avastin, costing \u00a33,370 for a month\u2019s treatment. The drug\u2019s use was accelerated by the US Food and Drug Administration which approved Avastin plus chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer in August 2014. Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread. Cervical cancer:\u00a0Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab and widely used in patients with bowel cancer, is the first new treatment since the chemotherapy drug topotecan was approved in 2006. Dr Mary McCormack, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at University College Hospital, said \u2018Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. \u2018For those women with metastatic disease (that has spread) or whose cancer recurs after surgery/chemoradiation there are very few treatment options. It is very welcome indeed that when Avastin is added to chemotherapy it prolongs survival by approximately four months. \u2018For a young mother sitting in front of you with small children, or indeed any patient with cancer, that length of time can be extremely important.\u2019 Robert Music, chief executive of Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said \u2018This regulatory decision for Avastin is positive news. To date, prognosis for women who receive a late-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer has often been poor. \u2018Any additional time that can be provided through new drugs with limited impact on quality of life is extremely valuable to patients and their families.\u2019 Trial findings show Avastin combined with chemotherapy can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 26 per cent compared with chemotherapy alone. The drug, made by Switzerland-based drug makers Roche, led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13 months. Avastin works by blocking the blood supply to the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. An independent blood supply is critical for a tumour to grow beyond 2mm and spread to other parts of the body.11 Tumours develop their own blood supply in a process called angiogenesis by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) \u2013 a key driver for tumour growth. Avastin is an antibody that precisely targets and inhibits VEGF.", "reference": "drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by european regulators . it has been available in england via cancer drugs fund since last march . 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from it each year . nearly 3,000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer in britain annually .", "sentences": ["avastin , which is used in several other cancers , gives women about four months ' extra life .", "the drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by european regulators .", "patients will have access via the cancer drugs fund ( cdf ) until it is considered for routine nhs use .", "each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from avastin , costing # 3,370 for a month 's treatment ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"avastin , which is used in several other cancers , gives women about four months ' extra life .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states Avastin gives women around four months' extra life, which aligns with this summary, but the summary's phrasing 'about four months' is slightly less precise but acceptable.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the drug plus chemotherapy has now been licensed by european regulators .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms that Avastin plus chemotherapy has been licensed by European regulators, matching this statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"patients will have access via the cancer drugs fund ( cdf ) until it is considered for routine nhs use .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states patients will have access via the CDF until it is considered for routine NHS use, which is consistent.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from avastin , costing # 3,370 for a month 's treatment .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript mentions an estimated 600 women could benefit and a cost of \u00a33,370 for a month\u2019s treatment, but the summary uses '#' instead of '\u00a3', which is a formatting error but not a factuality error.\",\n    \"category\": \"other error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "other error"]}

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?.' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'", "reference": "residents at hebrew care home in new york are woken by video recordings from loved ones to help ease their confusion and agitation . idea was inspired by the 2004 film 50 first dates starring adam sandler . experiment will be evaluated next month but results are ` very positive ' .", "sentences": ["Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients is taking place in New York .", "The hope is that the videos shown to residents will ease their confusion , forgetfulness and agitation .", "Idea borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates , in which Drew Barrymore 's character suffers a brain injury ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Hollywood-inspired experiment to help dementia patients is taking place in New York.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript specifies that the experiment is taking place at the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, New York, which is a care home, not necessarily a broad 'in New York' statement, but the location is consistent.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"The hope is that the videos shown to residents will ease their confusion , forgetfulness and agitation.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that the videos aim to help residents by setting a positive tone, easing confusion, forgetfulness, and agitation, aligning with this summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Idea borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates , in which Drew Barrymore 's character suffers a brain injury.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript mentions the film 50 First Dates and describes the plot involving memory loss, but it does not specify that Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury; it only states she has memory loss and the film's premise.

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th.

Documented and undocumented immigrants in the United States could reach a record high in the United States by 2023, when their share of the population could hit 14.8 per cent That number could rise to one in five by 2060, when immigrant population reaches 78 million. This report comes as President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand\u00a0Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) policies. Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population Center for Immigration Studies This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million) \u00a0by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which\u00a0could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner.

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.'

Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times\u00a0that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult \u2014 it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen. Alison Hargreaves (pictured with Tom and his sister Katie as children) was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalalayn mountain in 1995 K2 is\u00a0regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top Mrs Hargreaves, pictured with her husband Jim and thier family, was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen Tragic: Mr Ballard was just six years old when his mother died on her way down from the summit of K2 Her decision to take on dangerous climbs while raising a young family was criticised by some, but she shrugged off the flak, saying that fathers who went climbing did not face the same scrutiny. When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb. Since then that's pretty much all I have done.'", "reference": "alison hargreaves , 32 , was killed in 1995 as she descended from k2 . now her son tom ballard plans to conquer treacherous mountain himself . his mother was swept to her death by 260mph winds atop the mountain . at 28,251 ft , k2 is considered more difficult to climb than mount everest .", "sentences": ["tom ballard , 26 , plans to climb k2 , 20 years after his mother died .", "alison hargreaves , 32 , was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the himalayan mountain in 1995 .", "she was only the second person to climb everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"tom ballard , 26 , plans to climb k2 , 20 years after his mother died .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states Tom Ballard is 26 and plans to climb K2 20 years after his mother died, which matches the summary accurately.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"alison hargreaves , 32 , was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the himalayan mountain in 1995 .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms Alison Hargreaves was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from a Himalayan mountain in 1995, consistent with the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"she was only the second person to climb everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states Alison Hargreaves was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen, which aligns with the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season.

Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think my nanna shouldn't do that, it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company. 'I realised how much I missed that, having someone to care for me and protect me and treat me like a lady.' Julia shows off her pole dancing skills.

Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from\u00a0Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to\u00a0The New York Daily News. At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously.

Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali,\u00a0- \u00a0the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.'

According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents,\u00a0The New York Daily News\u00a0said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.'

Barrientos has been arrested multiple times, including for loitering, drug possession, and jumping a turnstile and trespassing, according to the Daily News.

The Times reported that for her first three 2002 marriages, Barrientos wed Koridze on Valentine's Day, before she went on to marry Goktepe approximately two weeks later, then soon tied the knot with Paharelau.

Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs.

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?.' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'", "reference": "residents at hebrew care home in new york are woken by video recordings from loved ones to help ease their confusion and agitation . idea was inspired by the 2004 film 50 first dates starring adam sandler . experiment will be evaluated next month but results are ` very positive ' .", "sentences": ["a UNK experiment to help dementia patients by waking up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place at a care home in new york .", "the idea is to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia .", "the programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a UNK experiment to help dementia patients by waking up with video recordings from loved ones is taking place at a care home in new york\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript specifies that the experiment is taking place in Riverdale, New York, and does not mention 'UNK' as part of the experiment's description.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the idea is to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that the programme is designed for people in the early to moderate stages of dementia who can recognize and understand the videos, aligning with this summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia\",\n    \"reason\": \"This sentence is a direct repetition of the previous one and accurately reflects the transcript's content.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "no error", "no error"]}

Allen splurged \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to Disney World However, the court heard he has assets including homes in Essex, Bishop Stortford, and southern Spain which he can sell to cover the repayment. A second defendant, Edward Byatt, 39, of Buckhurst Hill, Essex, was ordered to pay back \u00a310,000 for his part in the fraud. His name was on the deeds for the home in Rayne, despite Allen living there with Ms Godwin and their young son. \u2018Grant Allen used other people in the laundering process. He is somehow involved in criminal behaviour,\u2019 prosecutor Charles Evans told the trial in 2013. \u2018The money would have been criminal proceeds.\u2019 During his trial, Allen claimed he worked as a meat trader and a builder, and suggested his funds had come from successful gambling ventures. The pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, including a trip to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, in 2009 worth \u00a37,600 Mr Evans told the jury: \u2018Grant Allen and Gaynor Godwin lived an enviable lifestyle and travelled to Dubai and America, sometimes travelling first class and staying in luxury hotels.\u2019 Godwin was cleared by the jury of conspiracy to remove criminal property after telling them she had no idea where Allen had got the large sums of money. But Allen and Byatt were both convicted after trial and were both in court to hear the order being made. The judge will consider on Thursday whether to impose on Allen a strict financial reporting order which would force him to present the authorities with regular documents showing his use of money.", "reference": "grant allen , 38 , spent # 30,000 holidaying with girlfriend gaynor godwin . he bought houses in costa del sol as well as in essex and hertfordshire . court heard meat trader hid fraud by funnelling cash into partner 's bank . allen was previously jailed for six years for fraud and money laundering .", "sentences": ["grant allen , 38 , of harlow , essex , travelled around the world with his girlfriend .", "he bought a holiday home on the costa del sol , spain , using criminally gained money .", "pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing # 30,000 between 2006 and 2010 .", "allen also splurged # 8,700 on a holiday to florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to disney world ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "OtherE", "OtherE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"grant allen , 38 , of harlow , essex , travelled around the world with his girlfriend .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Grant Allen traveled around the world with his girlfriend Gaynor Godwin, but the summary omits her name and the specific mention of traveling 'around the world' is implied but not explicitly confirmed in the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"he bought a holiday home on the costa del sol , spain , using criminally gained money .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms that Allen bought a holiday home on the Costa del Sol using proceeds from the fraud, so this statement is accurate.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"pair stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing # 30,000 between 2006 and 2010 .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that the couple stayed at top hotels on at least eight holidays costing \u00a330,000 between 2006 and 2010, so this is consistent.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"allen also splurged # 8,700 on a holiday to florida in 2009 when he took his girlfriend and children to disney world .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms Allen spent \u00a38,700 on a holiday to Florida in 2009 with his girlfriend and children, so this is accurate.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.", "reference": "the 800-plus volcanic and coral islands that make up the pacific nation of fiji enjoy a tropical climate and host a significant tourism industry.", "sentences": ["fiji has been chosen as the country\\'s first democratically elected indian prime minister, who has died at the age of 27."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"fiji has been chosen as the country's first democratically elected Indian prime minister, who has died at the age of 27.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Fiji's first ethnic Indian prime minister was held hostage in 2000, not that Fiji itself was chosen as a country or that the prime minister died at 27; there is no mention of such an event or age.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Victory over fourth-placed Valencia will take Enrique's men at least temporarily five points clear at the top of the table with title rivals Real Madrid not kicking off against Malaga until evening. But with Valencia visiting the Nou Camp in the midst of a 10-match unbeaten run Enrique has stressed the importance of forgetting Wednesday night's superb 3-1 semi-final first leg win in Paris. Barcelona boss Luis Enrique has urged his side to switch their attention back to the La Liga title race Luis Suarez starred in Barcelona's 3-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain by bagging a brace Barcelona midfielder Andreas Iniesta has been ruled out of his side's league encounter against Valencia Enrique said: 'We are not thinking about the PSG match, we are only thinking about the visit of Valencia. 'Mentally we will have no problems because the players know if they are not 100 per cent against Valencia things will get complicated, but physically there are one or two things we have to assess.' Andreas Iniesta is definitely ruled out for Barca after he was forced off early in the second half of the 3-1 win in the French capital with a bruised pelvis. Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo insisted he was impressed but undaunted by Barca's performance over PSG as his side look to pull off a shock win which will strengthen their grip on fourth place. Santo said: 'What we have seen confirms what we already thought. They are a great team with great players. They don't have many weaknesses, but they do have some.' Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco is expected to replace the injured Benzema for Saturday's clash Malaga pulled off a stunning 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp in June and Ancelotti has warned his players they must wipe thoughts of their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico if they are to avoid a similar fate. Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality. They beat Barcelona at home and we need to focus on this match in order to win it.'

Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal.

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: \u2018A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.\u2019", "reference": "britain ranks as just 27th best country in the world for health and wellness . obesity levels were the main factor pushing britain down in health ranking . study shows uk came 11th in countries with high standards of prosperity .", "sentences": ["Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings .", "Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure .", "Overall , the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance , putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that obesity was the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings, confirming this statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on the measure of obesity levels.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Overall , the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance , putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms that the UK ranked 11th in the overall table of prosperity, health, and tolerance, and that this ranking places it outside the top ten.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. Later Nagaland Government said he was innocent.", "reference": "taxi driver has been arrested on suspicion of molesting a british woman . man , known as salim , is accused of assaulting tourist in jaipur , india . police confirmed he is being held after statement taken from alleged victim . incident follows a number of sexual attacks in india , on locals and tourists .", "sentences": ["driver , known as salim , is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in jaipur .", "the man , from todabhim in karauli district of rajasthan , is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody .", "he was arrested under section 354 of ipc ( indian penal code ) ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"driver , known as salim , is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in jaipur .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states the tourist was assaulted by a taxi driver in Jaipur and refers to the driver as Salim, aligning with the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the man , from todabhim in karauli district of rajasthan , is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms the man is from Todabhim in Karauli district, accused of assaulting the woman, and is in custody, matching the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"he was arrested under section 354 of ipc ( indian penal code ) .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states the arrest was made under Section 354 of IPC, consistent with the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla. 'My progress has been fairly slow but, to me, the most important thing is that I didn't give up.' Scroll down for video Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.' Barely-there biceps: In October 2013, pictured, Aliesha had only just started going to the gym to help her improve her depression Welcome to the gun show: Pictured this month, Aliesha's arms have grown much more muscular; she says she now loves going to the gym Of course, Aliesha added, it isn't always easy to maintain the motivation to work out five to seven days a week, but sticking to a routine has helped. 'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded. 'My friends and family have all noticed the difference, my relationships are stronger, I feel better about myself, and I'm constantly striving for self improvement.'", "reference": "aliesha peterson , 22 , from canada , says a therapist recommended she start exercising to improve her depression . she writes on reddit that after ` slow ' progress for 20 months , she now sees an improvement in her mood and her body .", "sentences": ["aliesha peterson , 22 , began exercising 20 months ago in an effort to lessen her depression .", "she detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs .", "as of april 2015 , she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"aliesha peterson , 22 , began exercising 20 months ago in an effort to lessen her depression .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states she started exercising in August 2013 and the article was referencing her progress as of April 2015, which is approximately 20 months, aligning with the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"she detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms her routine included exercises like squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks, and that she lost about 18-20 lbs, going from 145 lbs to 127 lbs, which matches the summary.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"as of april 2015 , she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that by April 2015, she had lost nearly 20 lbs and gained a six-pack, which directly supports this statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Knowing I might have to change her on the dirty floors of standard accessible toilets that just aren't suitable if there is not a Changing Places nearby when we go out as a family is so stressful.My daughter is only six so she doesn't have any knowledge of what she is going to be put through, but I know and the thought of that makes me feel so guilty.Lorna has also submitted written evidence to the Women and Equalities parliamentary committee who are currently gathering evidence about how accessible the built environment is for disabled people.There are currently 893 Changing Places toilets in the UK but what exactly are they?They are different from standard disabled toilets as they have extra features and more space to help meet  the needs of people who use them.Mike LeSurf, Changing Places Development Officer at Mencap says: There are potentially over a quarter of a million people who need a Changing Places toilet - because behind the standard accessible toilet door, people's needs are not being met.Alison Beevers describes the psychological effect on the whole family of not having an appropriate place for a change as her son Freddie gets older and their options for outings are slowly flushed away.Imagine having to get down on your hands and knees and laying down on a dirty floor or squashing yourself into the back of your car just because there isn't a bench and hoist in the toilet, she says.You just begin to get this sense of feeling like you're last in the line to be considered.It's soul-destroying and you don't feel like a valued member of society at all.But it is not all doom and gloom and Alison gets by with a little help from her friends.She said: Freddie went to a party and one of my friends converted a room into a 'pop-up' changing places, and brought stuff from home to kit it out - it was amazingAlison even tweeted from the party: Friends for life are those who organise parties in the village hall and provide a 'pop up' #changingplace so ALL can go!Bethan Folen and her daughter Lowri also enjoy their girls' days out now there are more convenient and fully accessible places to change nearby.She said: Lowri's favourite thing to do is to go to the Millennium Stadium [now known as the Principality Stadium] in Cardiff and watch Wales play rugby. She is a massive fan.Even before the stadium installed its Changing Places toilet, says Bethan, There were some nearby in the centre of Cardiff and it made things so much easier whenever we needed to change LowriChanging Places specifications have been included in the Building Standards guidelines (BS 8300:2009) since 2009 as a recommendation rather than a compulsory requirement.Architect Vaila Morrison explains why this creates a problem.By making it compulsory to have a Changing Places toilet in larger complexes then you will give people clarity over what is expected as there is none at the moment, she says.As a designer you tend to focus on what you have to do in line with compulsory legislation and recommendations can be ignored because of this.For businesses, especially those in already existing buildings, logistical and financial barriers to installing these toilets can sometimes block plans.At 12 square metres (3m x 4m) Changing Places are considerably larger than the standard accessible toilet (1,5m x 2.2m).Because of this campaigners are focusing their efforts on making it compulsory for newly built larger complexes such as shopping centres, cinemas and sports stadiums in the building regulations.Arsenal Football Club, who were the first side in the Premier League to install a Changing Places toilet, have seen a very positive reaction not just from fans but from the general public too.Alun Francis, Disability Liaison Officer at the club, said: There were challenges and despite already having 38 wheelchair accessible toilets we were constrained by the original building design as it existed before the recommendations came in, so we had to adapt.But working with the people behind the Changing Places group was such a positive experience.They looked at our ideas to convert two of the existing toilets into one Changing Place and helped us find a way around things so we could make it possible.You need to think about all of your customers when you run any type of venue and if you want their custom you have to make things accessible for them - it's important.", "reference": "what would you do if you had to travel miles to go to the toilet, to avoid being changed on a dirty floor or in the back of a car?", "sentences": ["the uk\\'s vote to leave the house of commons on the issue of disabled people\\'s toilets is a campaign by mps and peers."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the uk's vote to leave the house of commons on the issue of disabled people's toilets is a campaign by mps and peers.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript does not mention any vote in the House of Commons or a campaign related to leaving the House on this issue; it discusses campaigns for making Changing Places toilets compulsory and related advocacy efforts.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October.

Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down. Spahic is expected to miss his side's trip to face Mainz in the Bundesliga on Saturday through injury but he could be in line for a longer spell on the sidelines if action is taken after the incident on Wednesday night.

One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.'

Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top?

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud.

They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane Sherwood (right) sits on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur staff Ferdinand (centre) and Ramsey (left) Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor celebrates his goal by saluting Sherwood (right) and Ramsey (centre) 'I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,' he said, with Villa in 17th. 'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here. 'Listen, I know I am biased - he has been good for me and I have been good for him. But he is up there with the very best coaches I have ever seen.'

And at least 15 per cent \u2013 more than 544,000 \u2013 are completely fake. StatusPeople.com, the oldest publicly available Twitter-auditing tool, reports that 44 per cent of the former secretary of state's followers are 'good'; 15 per cent are 'fake'; and 41 per cent are 'inactive,' meaning that they never tweet or reply to any tweets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO FAKERS: According to one popular online audit tool, only 44 per cent of Hillary Clinton's Twitter followers are real people who participate on the social media platform 'I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT': Clinton has cast herself as a champion of 'everyday Americans' Another Twitter sleuthing website sampled more than 320,000 of Clinton's followers and found that a much larger number of them were 'fake' Just 4 per cent of President Barack Obama's Twitter followers, by comparison, are considered fake. The White House worked overtime to purge most of them after a September 2013 report found that more than half\u00a0of his followers didn't really exist. Michelle Obama's Twitter audience is 25 per cent fake, according to StatusPeople, along with 21 per cent of Vice President Joe Biden's. Another tool, TwitterAudit.com, sampled 320,000 of Mrs. Clinton's followers and found that 18 per cent were fake. The new measurements will add to the Clinton presidential campaign's embarrassment following news on Tuesday that a large number of her Facebook fans may represent 'likes' that were purchased rather than earned. REALLY? Hillary Clinton's Twitter follower-count appears to be significantly inflated FACEBOOK FAKERY: Clinton boasts two-thirds of a million Facebook 'likes,' but more than 46,000 of them list 'Baghdad' as their hometown Vocativ reported that at least 7 per cent of them listed Baghdad, Iraq as their hometown, a larger number than any U.S. city. That would represent more than 46,000 people. Additional evidence of digital astroturfing is that while most of her U.S. Facebook fans are older than 55, most of the Baghdad contingent is in the 18-34 age range. While Clinton was America's top diplomat, her State Department was buying Facebook 'likes,'\u00a0according to an Associated Press report from last year. 'In 2013, the State Department, which has more than 400,000 likes and was recently most popular in Cairo, said it would stop buying Facebook fans after its inspector general criticized the agency for spending $630,000 to boost the numbers,' the wire service reported. Clinton left the agency while the inspector general was investigating. ASTROTURF? A woman cast as a kindly, gardening grandma in Clinton's campaign launch video is actually a former abortion lobbyist who once helmed a campaign for Texas state Senator Wendy Davis WHERE'S SCOOBY? Clinton's caravan was spotted in Maumee, Ohio on Monday when she lunched at Chipotle, but no one recognized her Facebook says it has entire teams of employees tasked with rooting out schemes to artificially boost statistics. 'When we catch fraudulent activity, we work to counter and prevent it \u2013 including blocking accounts and removing fake likes,' the company reports on its website.

The latests picture, captured by an amateur photographer as the Colima volcano in Mexico spews out a plume of ash and lava, reveals the raw power of a volcanic eruption. Hernando Rivera Cervantes took the pictures as local authorities warned those living around the volcano, which is also known as the Fire volcano, to prepare for a possible evacuation. Lightning strikes inside the enormous ash cloud thrown into the air by the Colima volcano (above) in Mexico The 12,400 feet (3,800 metre) high volcano, which first erupted in 1576, is one of the most active volcanoes in Mexico. Mr Cervantes spent eight hours watching the volcano as it threw ash up to 1.8 miles (three kilometres) into the atmosphere before managing to capture the rare picture. He said: 'I waited for eight hours, knowing something was going to happen. When the lightning arrived it was magical. An unforgettable experience.' These blots of lightning are thought to occur due to the build up of electric charge in the ash cloud as the particles rub against each other. Just like in a thunder cloud, this charge eventually builds up until it seeks a path through to the ground as lightning. This sequence of images captured by photographer\u00a0Hernando Rivera Cervantes show the lightning flashes as the Colima volcano erupted Mr Cervantes also managed to capture this night-time image above of lava spilling from the erupting volcano Small volcanic eruptions over the past 20 years have been protecting the Earth from global warming, according to a recent study. Scientists have confirmed that droplets of sulphur-rich aerosols spewed into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes have been reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. Until recently it was thought that only particularly large eruptions had any noticeable affect on the climate. However, a study published earlier this year has confirmed results from the end of last year that showed these small eruptions can have an accumulative impact on global temperature. This could have helped decrease the global temperatures by between 0.05\u00b0C to 0.12\u00b0C over the past 15 years. Earlier this month scientists discovered that it is this lightning that is responsible for making the glass spheres that can appear in volcanic rocks. They found that the intense heat generated by the lightning bolts causes the ash to melt into spherules of smooth glass. A bolt of volcanic lighting can heat the surrounding air to more than 3,000\u00b0C, according to the researchers from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. Dr Kimberly Genareau, a volcanologist at the University of Alabama, said their findings\u00a0suggested that the role lightning plays in volcanic eruptions may be under reported. Writing in the journal Geology, she said: 'We refer to this new morphological classification of ash grains as lightning-induced volcanic spherules (LIVS). 'Observation of LIVS in tephras (volcanic rocks) will provide evidence of lightning occurrence during eruptions where lightning was not directly observed or documented.' The Colima volcano is actually one of three volcanic domes that make up the Colima Volcanic complex in the Mexican state of Colima, 301 miles west of Mexico City. It has erupted around 40 times since its first recorded activity in 1576. There are now around 300,000 people living in it shadow. The volcano has a history of large and explosive eruptions, which has meant it is also one of the most studied volcanoes in Mexico. Although lightning in volcanic ash clouds has been observed for a long time, scientists have only recently begun to understand what causes it. The Colima volcano is regarded as one of the most dangerous in Mexico due to its large explosive eruptions Mr Cervantes (shown above) spent eight hours waiting to capture his stunning images of the Colima volcano Getting close enough to an erupting volcano is dangerous, so scientists at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich recreated volcanic lightning in a lab. In 2013 they suspended volcanic ash gathered from sites around the world in a chamber filled with argon gas, forcing the concoction through a narrow tube. They found that the movement of ash particles against each other as they go from the compressed environment under the Earth's surface into the atmosphere during an eruption causes a built of up static charge. When the ash reaches the atmosphere, the energy is discharged as lightning bolts.", "reference": "lightning flash spotted in the ash cloud of the colima volcano which is 301 miles west of mexico city . strikes caused by high levels of electric charge building up as ash particles rub together . bolts can heat surrounding air to 3,000 \u00b0c and melt ash in the cloud into glassy spheres , scientists discovered .", "sentences": ["photographer spotted the UNK volcano in mexico UNK out a plume of ash and lava .", "the UNK volcano , which first erupted in UNK , is one of the most active volcanoes in mexico ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "EntE", "GramE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"photographer spotted the UNK volcano in mexico UNK out a plume of ash and lava .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript specifies that the volcano is the Colima volcano in Mexico, and the photographer captured an ash and lava plume, but 'UNK' indicates missing or unknown information, which is not present in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the UNK volcano , which first erupted in UNK , is one of the most active volcanoes in mexico .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that the Colima volcano first erupted in 1576 and is one of the most active in Mexico, but 'UNK' indicates missing or unknown details, which are not present in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "out-of-context error"]}

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.", "reference": "the party of nigeria\\'s incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party\\'s dominance.", "sentences": ["nigeria\\'s main opposition party has suffered its biggest defeat since the end of the country\\'s four-year elections."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"nigeria's main opposition party has suffered its biggest defeat since the end of the country's four-year elections.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The summary incorrectly states that the opposition party suffered its biggest defeat since the end of 'four-year elections,' which is not mentioned in the transcript; it also mischaracterizes the nature of the defeat as the biggest since a specific event that is not detailed.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

The pundit has claimed his old club would be relegated if there were 10 games left to play instead of just five. The Magpies will set a new club record of seven straight Premier League defeats should they be beaten at home by Swansea. Newcastle manager John Carver is not happy with recent criticism aimed at his struggling side Carver has been left with a sour taste in his mouth following Michael Owen's recent relegation jibe Michael Owen captained the Newcastle side which was relegated to the Championship in 2009 Newcastle are seven points off the relegation zone Owen has been joined by the likes of Phil Neville and Sportsmail\u2019s Jamie Carragher in criticising both the team and the lack of ambition at the club, whose supporters will again protest against owner Mike Ashley. But Carver says he does not listen to those who have never tried management, including Owen, who was relegated with Newcastle in 2009. \u2018I could be nasty about Michael because let\u2019s not forget what happened when he was here,\u2019 said Carver. \u2018But listen, I don\u2019t have a problem with anyone having an opinion. Where I have the problem is with people who have never been in this situation - never been in my situation now. \u2018They have never had to sit here and pick a team when you have got so many injuries, suspensions, or dealing with situations on the training ground or something from left field that you think, Where\u2019s that come from?\u201d.\u2019 He added: \u2018Let\u2019s not start a war here because I accept that the likes of Michael Owen and Jamie Carragher have played hundreds of Premier League football matches and I haven\u2019t. I understand that. \u2018But sometimes there has to be a little bit of sympathy with the people doing this job. When you have never gone in and put your foot in the water and tested it, then it is a little different. \u2018There are a lot of people out there who don\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. \u2018It\u2019s easy talking with a tactics board and dobbers, but all of a sudden in this position you have to make a decision because your back four is not high enough and someone is causing you problems because of it. If you don\u2019t see that during a game then you have a problem. People don\u2019t see that.\u2019 Carver, though, does have time for the likes of Graeme Souness and Peter Reid, the former managers of Newcastle and Sunderland respectively. \u2018I never listened to Graeme when I was academy director here but what I will say is that he talks an awful lot of sense on the TV,\u2019 said United\u2019s head coach. \u2018And when I see someone like Peter Reid on TV, who has been in this situation and has managed in this region, he understands what it feels like. I respect what he says.\u2019 Newcastle ace Siem de Jong will be included on the substitutes' bench for his side's match against Swansea Meanwhile, Newcastle will include Siem de Jong on the bench for the first time since August. The \u00a36million former Ajax skipper has suffered a torn thigh muscle and collapsed lung this season and has started just one Premier League game. But Carver said: \u2018You can see what a talent Siem is. I remember watching him play against Man City in the Champions League. He scored two at the Etihad and I thought, \u201cWhat a player he is\u201d. \u2018If I see anything like that then I will be delighted. He is a super lad and is a talented footballer.

'You saw how far the drop was and you just couldn't believe the kid didn't hurt himself from falling down on the ground,' Lurie told WKYC. 'I was just shocked,' he said. 'I didn't understand how the parents let the kid go over the thing.' The cheetahs did not approach the boy or his parents while in the pit, according to zoo officials. Zoo visitor Terra Lurie believes the boy was not approached by the fast feline because they were frightened. 'I think they were just curious as to what was going on and why somebody was in the pen with them,' she said. 'It's not every day that somebody is just in the pen with them.' 'And everyone else is screaming and they probably got scared.' Kuhar said the zoo had received 'a number of eyewitness accounts' that indicate the 'strong likelihood that the child was dangled over the railing,' he told NewsNet5. Cleveland Metroparks Zoo has plans to press child endangerment charges against the family on Monday. The exhibit was closed following the child's fall.

Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time.Foran has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above.Tansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect.Another Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure.In truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break.Billy Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive.And, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over.Martin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham.And Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.Referee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.Having offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.Dougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.Redmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.Match ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.Second Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.Goal!

The Conference bent over backwards to help them.I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to \u00a3148,000.That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for \u00a31 and clear their \u00a3220,000 debts22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June.

Pricey promposals: Students this year will likely spend of a third of their prom budgets on the elaborate new ritual of promposals, according to a survey of 3,000 people conducted by Visa That's according to a survey from Visa, which asked 3,000 people aged 18 or older what they expected to shell out for the prom and on what. For a primer on promposals, see previous years' winners of most outrageous (and viral) prom proposals. In 2012, Matthew Ho from Toronto promposed to his girlfriend, Tina, with 1,500 pink helium balloons and a sign that read, 'Tina, will you go to prom with me?'

His stunt attracted a crowd in the hallway, giving the blindfolded Tina an audience when the stunt was finally revealed Some students have even rented plane banners to pop the prom question - at a starting cost of $1,000 in the New York area. 'It started last year \u2014 I've been in the business six years, and we had never sold a prom banner before then,' explained Remy Colin of Aerial Messages in Daytona Beach, Florida. At John B. Alexander High School in Laredo, Texas, senior student Isaac Garza asked his best friend, Kristelle, to prom in dramatic pre-planned chase scene with the school . Dressed in a tuxedo, and running into a packed assembly hall where Kristelle was waiting, unaware of what was going on, Mr Garza performed a rendition of Heath Ledger's famous scene in Ten Things I Hate About You, singing Lauren Hill's Can't Take My Eyes Off of You.

As students reached question three, where Mr Vanenberg laid out statistical quandaries to Miss Dillon's yes or no answer, they realized their probability questionnaire was a ruse. When student Taylor Huestis opened her locker, 456 ping pong balls, all with 'prom' written on them, fell onto the floor. Huestis' boyfriend had planned the stunt for days, enlisting the help of her friends; his sign read 'I finally had the balls to ask you to prom!' Visa's prom survey also revealed some interesting regional and economic disparities.

One third of the \u00a318bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors.Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the \u00a318bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project.This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact.EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished.Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy?Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes betTom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible.We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies, he said.Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments.Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties.Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement.Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as a unique asset for French and British industries, saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment.However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity.Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners.Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) to help pay for the project.Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was very risky financially.Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself.5,600workers on site at peak4,000km electrical cabling230,000 tonnes of steel5.6m cubic metres of earth to be movedEnvironmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money.He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians.The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind.Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mixMar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approvedOct 2013 - UK government agrees \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the timeOct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN)July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.", "reference": "plans to build the first new uk nuclear plant in 20 years have suffered an unexpected delay after the government postponed a final decision until the early autumn.", "sentences": ["plans to build a power plant in the centre of hinkley point have been suspended by the government, the government has said."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"plans to build a power plant in the centre of hinkley point have been suspended by the government, the government has said.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript indicates that the government is reviewing the project and has not explicitly suspended it; it is described as a 'pause' or 'review,' not a suspension.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco is expected to replace the injured Benzema for Saturday's clash Malaga pulled off a stunning 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp in June and Ancelotti has warned his players they must wipe thoughts of their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico if they are to avoid a similar fate. Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality. They beat Barcelona at home and we need to focus on this match in order to win it.' Atletico Madrid will look to consolidate their grip on third place as they travel to a Deportivo La Coruna side for whom two successive draws has left them sitting above the relegation zone on goal difference alone. James Rodriguez (left) is likely to play in a central attacking role alongside club team-mate Isco Gareth Bale (pictured) and Cristiano Ronaldo will be tasked with scoring goals in Benzema's absence Bale sprints ahead of Luka Modric during Friday's training session ahead of Real's clash against Malaga Also on Saturday, mid-table Athletic Bilbao look to return to winning ways after three games without a victory as they take on Getafe, for whom three games unbeaten have effectively ended relegation fears. Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal.

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.", "reference": "the party of nigeria\\'s incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party\\'s dominance.", "sentences": ["nigeria\\'s main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria\\'s presidential election."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that APC, not the main opposition party, won the presidential election, and it was Buhari's victory, not the opposition party's overall win.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}
{"doc_id": "8610ead0a43054be202a1fc756620415a6d572fe", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "s2s", "transcript": "(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is service of process? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go off the grid. Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is nail and mail service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of service is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, traditional doesn't necessarily mean good.  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be liked by all your gawking friends, we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we live in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.", "reference": "a court allowed a wife to serve divorce papers via facebook . danny cevallos : why not let people be found via social media ? .", "sentences": ["a new york judge rules that divorce papers on a husband ca n't be trusted .", "if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it .", "if you 're going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a new york judge rules that divorce papers on a husband ca n't be trusted .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that a judge authorized service of divorce papers via Facebook, but does not say the papers can't be trusted; it discusses the method of service, not its trustworthiness.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This statement aligns with the transcript's explanation that serving papers is based on the principle that defendants should be notified of lawsuits, which is a core idea in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"if you 're going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This sentence is a paraphrase of the previous one and is consistent with the transcript's content about the importance of notifying defendants; no factual discrepancy is present.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "no error", "no error"]}

Official documents and private communications are made public, and websites blocked. They hijack CCTV cameras, electronic billboards and network printers.The best known of the virtual warriors are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, the Cyber Berkut and Anonymous International.All three present themselves as independent activists, separate from other, government-sponsored groups.The most prominent pro-Ukrainians hackers are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops, led by Kiev-based programmer Yevhen Dokukin.Most recently, he claimed to have hacked into two Russian interior ministry servers and an email account used by police in Russia's Rostov region - bordering Ukraine's eastern separatist regions.I gave all this data to Ukraine's security service, but they still can't get round to analysing it, so do it yourselves, he urged readers on Facebook.Volunteer activist group Inform Napalm sifted through more than 35 gigabytes of the data and found what looked like official reports confirming that Russian military servicemen were among the hundreds of people evacuated to Russia after being wounded in Ukraine.The Ukrainian Cyber Troops make extensive use of one of the most tried and tested tools in cyber warfare, the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack.DDoS attacks are the Ukrainian Cyber Troops' artillery, Mr Dokukin likes saying. Scores of rebel websites were made inaccessible when the Ukrainian Cyber Troops relentlessly bombarded them with fake service requests.To disrupt separatist funding, they target accounts held by rebels in electronic payment systems such as PayPal and WebMoney.The Cyber Troops have also hacked into public CCTV systems in rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine and monitor them for the movement of troops and military hardware.On 8 December, Yevhen Dokukin claimed to have hijacked network printers in eastern Ukraine and Crimea to print pro-Ukrainian messages and insults against Russian President Vladimir Putin.Some media reports suggest that Ukraine's security services have used information obtained by hackers to direct artillery fire.But officials deny this. We only use data obtained by people we trust and know, Ukrainian military spokesman Oleksiy Dmytrashkivsky told the BBC.On the other side of the conflict is Cyber Berkut, a staunchly anti-Western group which takes its name from the riot police used against protesters during the unrest in Kiev that led to the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych.The group's declared goal is thwarting Ukraine's military plans and thus stopping the genocide that it accuses Kiev of unleashing at America's behest. Its motto is We won't forgive or forget, and its rhetoric closely resembles that of Russian state media.During US Vice-President Joe Biden's visit to Kiev on 20-21 November, Cyber Berkut hacked several Ukrainian government websites, placing a message on their front pages which read: Joseph Biden is the fascists' master.Cyber Berkut claims to have retrieved confidential documents from a mobile device used by one member of Mr Biden's team while it was in Kiev. The documents appear to detail Washington's military assistance to Ukraine.Another stunt carried out by Cyber Berkut is the apparent hacking of electronic billboards in Kiev, which were made to show a video branding Ukrainian officials and activists war criminals and featuring highly graphic images of civilians killed in the current conflict.They also claim to have disrupted the electronic vote-counting systems ahead of October's parliamentary election in Ukraine, to have leaked Ukrainian defence ministry data on losses and desertions, and to have blocked President Petro Poroshenko's website.In addition, Russian tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda quoted a Facebook conversation allegedly hacked by Cyber Berkut, in which Ukrainian officials appear to admit that their forces downed Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.The claim went largely ignored elsewhere and has never been verified.Russian activist group Anonymous International made its name by publishing leaked documents from the Kremlin. It is otherwise known as b0ltai or Shaltay Boltay, which translates as Humpty Dumpty.What is not clear is whether it obtains material through hacking or are given it by Kremlin insiders.The group focuses on Russia's domestic affairs, but some of its material covers Ukraine.In  November it published a letter from a Russian fighter in eastern Ukraine suggesting that locals did not support the separatist forces.And in May it made headlines leaking what it said were emails to and from former Russian FSB colonel Igor Girkin, also known as Strelkov, who was then a key rebel commander in eastern Ukraine.Access to Anonymous International's website is currently blocked in Russia.BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

On the table the five-time world champion enjoyed a successful day, firing two rapid centuries in establishing a 12-4 lead, needing just one more in Monday's closing session to the match to reach the quarter-finals.

Ronnie O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Olivier Marteel in his second round match against Matthew Stevens O'Sullivan is spoken to by referee Marteel in his second round match against Stevens at the Crucible Marteel approached O'Sullivan as he walked to the table when Stevens missed a red, telling O'Sullivan he had noticed his hand gesture, which was thought to have been self-directed. O'Sullivan avoided a fine in the first round when he briefly played without shoes after a new pair proved uncomfortable, breaking the rules but not sufficiently to warrant any punishment, after he accepted a substitute pair of size eights, loaned by tournament director Mike Ganley.

Andrew told her: \u2018You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).\u2019 He then turned to the lance corporal and added: \u2018If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...\u2019 There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. Eugenie looked delighted and said she was \u2018very proud, Pops\u2019 of her father\u2019s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored \u2018zero points\u2019. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie Sarah added: \u2018We think you all need to go for choir practice.\u2019 Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. \u2018Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,\u2019 he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: \u2018\u2019What was it somebody said about children and dogs?\u2019 The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

Authorities said the Northern California boy fell asleep in the backseat of the car and was kidnapped when the vehicle was stolen An eight-year-old boy who took a snooze in the backseat of his family's car, apparently slept through his own kidnapping after the car was stolen from in front of his home. Brock Guzman was found safe and well about two miles away from his Northern Californian home in the abandoned car following a frantic search for him. Police said a hapless car thief likely stole the 2001 Toyota Corolla after the boy's father left it running and briefly unattended in front of his home. But the car thief clearly didn't notice the boy curled up on the backseat fast asleep as he sped away with the vehicle. The boy's father said he had placed Brock in the Corolla at around 4:45 a.m., and started the engine. He then went back into the house in Fairfield to get some belongings and his older son, who attends school 40 miles away in Napa. However, when the father went back outside, the car was gone and an unfamiliar bicycle lay nearby. In a blind panic, he hopped into another family vehicle and sped off in search of the Corolla. The boy's mother frantically called 911, and authorities issued an Amber Alert. Less than four hours later, a resident called police and said the car was parked in their neighborhood. When officers cautiously approached it at around 8:15 a.m., the suspect was gone and Brock was still asleep. He was not injured. Fairfield police Officer Kathryn McCormick said: 'We don't know for sure if he slept through the whole thing, but it looks that way. We hope that was the case.' Police do not have a description of the suspect and say it appears that the thief did not know the child was sleeping in the backseat. 'At this point, we are investigating this as a crime of opportunity,' McCormick said.

Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture.

The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday\u2019s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday \u2018I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. \u2018It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I\u2019ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,\u2019 Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. \u2018It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. \u2018I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. \u2018I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don\u2019t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.\u2019 Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. \u2018I am loving my job at the moment,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.\u2019 It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC\u2019s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Has established a rapport at Surrey with the out-of-favour Kevin Pietersen \u2014 says English cricket needs to be bold. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He\u2019s only interested if there\u2019s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer. REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Widely respected within English cricket for taking the team to the top of the Test rankings. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: Strauss is still in the early days of his career as a commentator \u2013 and is enjoying it. Michael Vaughan (Age 40) CURRENT JOB: Broadcaster and columnist. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Famously led England to the 2005 Ashes \u2014 and 26 Test wins overall, a national record. PLAYERS HE LIKES: Joe Root is a particular favourite \u2014 he is next in line to replace Alastair Cook as Test captain.

It makes it look as big as it can possibly be, with its arms spread out below and the mantle, the back part of the animal, raised over the head.The dark colour is produced in concert with those size-accentuating behaviours. There's no particular physiological reason why darkness should be associated with aggression, but it does give the impression of a larger object.The researchers, based in Australia and the US, dubbed the stance the Nosferatu pose, referring to the classic 1920s horror film, because the spread of the octopus's web was reminiscent of a vampire's cape.Octopuses frequently turned pale while retreating from aggressors and also produced high-contrast patterns known as deimatic displays.The contrasting patterns were most frequently observed when octopuses were attempting to return to their den after they had been forced out, or in the presence of an aggressive individual.Suppose there's a large, aggressive guy there and you want to get back into our den, if you approach with a pale colour it could be interpreted as a non-confrontational behaviour, Prof Godfrey-Smith said.The study also found that two octopuses displaying dark colours were likely to fight if in close proximity, while a darker-coloured octopus was likely to stand its ground against a lighter-coloured octopus.Another cephalopod, the cuttlefish, shows a similar set of features, with aggressive males darkening their faces and paler males withdrawing from fights.The unusually high number of octopuses living together in the colony off Jervis Bay, south of Sydney, allowed a more in-depth observation of interactions than had previously been possible.Prof Godfrey-Smith's co-author David Scheel and his students combed through 53 hours of footage and observed 186 interactions between the octopuses.This included the Nosferatu pose, along with reaching, grappling and mating.Watching these long videos was much more exhausting than I expected, Prof Godfrey Smith said.Identifying an individual from minute to minute is very difficult, because they change colour and shape.If the octopus wanders out of the frame, there's not much you can do.", "reference": "octopuses may have more complex social interactions than previously believed, a new study has found.", "sentences": ["a new study suggests that some of the world\\'s most provocative colour colour can be used to harass the octopus."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a new study suggests that some of the world's most provocative colour colour can be used to harass the octopus.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript mentions high-contrast patterns and colour changes used in aggressive or retreating behaviours, but does not describe them as 'provocative' or as a means to 'harass' the octopus.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey, and I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here. And, finally, Lose some weight, baby girl. It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and ugly on the inside to a sad, self-hating coward. ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the power of the press without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and the return of class -- who express views like, Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies.

'Take it easy, just calm down,' Asberg tells him. The friends sprang into action after a frantic conductor yelled over the intercom: 'Are there any police officers on the train?' As the train pulled into the Bleeker Street station, the Nordic lawmen found a homeless man pummeling another rider in the next car.

But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington,\u00a0Washington County, Utah The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing\u00a0Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda,\u00a0Humboldt County Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow\u00a0town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com\u00a0so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them.

Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London.Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010.The documents say the charity would help the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress.Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable.In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants.The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property.The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation.But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room.One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.It's all about the money, it's not about the people, he added. I thought inspections would be made.Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m.The council said it has a dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable.Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees.He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients.He also said his company was genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property.Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.It also said it did not have authority from the relevant parties to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing.", "reference": "a letting agency has been paid more than # 5.5 m in housing benefit after its owner set up a charity to help the homeless, the bbc has learned.", "sentences": ["a scheme that helps homeless people living in the uk has been launched by private landlords."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a scheme that helps homeless people living in the uk has been launched by private landlords.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript describes a scheme involving a charity (Fresh Start Housing) and a company (Investing Solutions) that facilitates housing for homeless people, with properties sourced from private landlords, but it does not specify that private landlords launched the scheme.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

But having a budget shop nearby means your house could sell for less In a study published today, Lloyds Bank investigated average house prices in postal districts that have chain supermarkets nearby, to see how they compared to the wider postal region. Houses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of \u00a3354,378 \u2013 which was \u00a338,831 (12 per cent) more than typical prices for their regions.

Waitrose has carefully cultivated its upmarket image, proving popular with middle and high income families.
