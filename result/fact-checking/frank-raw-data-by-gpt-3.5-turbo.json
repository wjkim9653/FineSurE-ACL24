Sky Bet Championship side Rovers were eliminated from the competition on Wednesday night by Brendan Rodgers' Liverpool, who booked a semi-final date at Wembley at the second time of asking thanks to Philippe Coutinho's angled 70th-minute finish in an Ewood Park replay. It ended a memorable FA Cup journey for Rovers that had included resounding home victories over Barclays Premier League sides Swansea and Stoke in previous rounds. Blackburn manager Gary Bowyer believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players The manner in which they dispatched those two, coupled with the fact they frustrated Liverpool for the majority of the 180 minutes, is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending. Bowyer is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets, having rejected advances for Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede in the past two transfer windows, and the Rovers boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months' time. 'What the players have done is they've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the Premier League,' he said. 'They've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the Premier League big boys. That's obviously the nature of the game that we're in, I'm not going to kid myself. 'It's the nature of business. If you look at all the clubs now, everybody sells. Liverpool sold (Luis) Suarez in the summer. 'You've seen over the two games against Liverpool and in previous games against Swansea and Stoke that we've got some very good young players. They're developing, they're growing and getting some real experience under their belts.' Blackburn strikers Jordan Rhodes and Rudy Gestede have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows Blackburn's owners Venky's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings, telling Hull and Crystal Palace that Rhodes and Gestede would be remaining in east Lancashire. However, that position may have to soften if Rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the Financial Fair Play regulations. Their recent failure to do so caused the Football League to place them under a transfer embargo which Bowyer knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit. 'You always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it,' he added. 'We've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo. The embargo's just caught up with us because we haven't been able to bring enough bodies in.' Bowyer shakes hands with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers ahead of Wednesday's FA Cup replay Indeed, Bowyer's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper Simon Eastwood in attack against Reading this Saturday. The stopper almost produced a moment for the FA Cup annals on Wednesday when, after coming up for a Tommy Spurr long throw, his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat Simon Mignolet in the Liverpool goal. 'We sent Easty up, more in hope than anything, we didn't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin,' Bowyer admitted. 'He's put himself forward for centre forward on Saturday!'

Holland, whose 5-1 drubbing of Spain in the group stage in Brazil last year marked the end of the Iberian nation's six-year domination of the world game, scored two early goals at the Amsterdam Arena and held on against some determined Spain pressure in the second half for a 2-0 success. They became the first team to inflict two defeats on Del Bosque since he took over in 2008 but the gruff 64-year-old had used the match to try out several new faces and he fielded a largely experimental, second-string team. Stefan de Vrij (right) headed Holland in front against Spain at the Amsterdam Arena on Tuesday Gerard Pique (left) could do nothing to stop Davy Klaassen doubling the Dutch advantage Malaga forward Juanmi and Sevilla midfielder Vitolo became the 55th and 56th players to debut under Del Bosque, while the likes of goalkeeper David de Gea, defenders Raul Albiol, Juan Bernat and Dani Carvajal and midfielder Mario Suarez all started the game. 'The national team's state of health is good,' centre back Gerard Pique told reporters. 'We are in a process where players are coming into the team and gathering experience,' added the Barcelona defender. 'We are second in qualifying (for Euro 2016) and these friendly games are for experimenting. 'I am not that worried about this match because we lost friendlies in previous years and then ended up winning titles.' David de Gea was given a start by Vicente del Bosque but could not keep out De Vrij's header here Dani Carvajal (centre) was another squad player given a chance to impress against Holland Del Bosque will be confident he can find the right mix of players to secure Spain's berth at Euro 2016 in France next year, when they will be chasing an unprecedented third straight title. Slovakia are the surprise leaders in qualifying Group C thanks to a 2-1 win over Spain in Zilina in October and have a maximum 15 points from five of 10 matches. Spain are second on 12 points, three ahead of Ukraine, who they beat 1-0 in Seville on Friday. Del Bosque's side host Slovakia in September in a match that could decide who goes through to the finals as group winners. 'The team is in good shape,' forward Pedro told reporters.

Whether it is Crocs, hotpants or UGG boots, everyone has their Achilles heel and this summer many will be concerned about the arrival of the septum piercing. In recent months, a whole host of stars have been wearing the body jewellery, including FKA Twigs, Rihanna and Lady Gaga. FKA Twigs has been one of the main trendsetters when it comes to the septum ring The septum ring isn't a new trend - the process of piercing the wall between the two nostrils has been done for years. It was a coming-of-age ritual for some North American tribes - the boys would be given the nose ring when they became a man, the Shawnee leaders Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa both had them. In certain warrior tribes, it was used in a similar way to war paint - to look terrifying in front of opponents. In Australia, Aboriginals used the piercing to try and flatten their nose, which they believed made them look more attractive. Lady Gaga (left) and Lourdes Leon (right) have both adopted the trend It girl Pixie Geldof wears a simple silver septum ring Rihanna wears an outlandish septum ring and offsets the look with a 90s bucket hat In India, and Bangladesh septum piercings are still very popular with women - many Bengali women wear it to show they are married, although this practice is being increasingly replaced with a nose stud. In Nepal, it is often used as a status symbol. The septum ring, which is also known\u00a0as the 'bull-ring piercing,' is also used as a way of controlling and handling bulls. But in the UK, America and Australia, it is mainly used as a fashion trend and to create a hippy or rebellious look.

Wellington is said to have more bars, restaurants and cafes per capita than New York \u2013 and they were certainly out in force during CubaDupa. More than 60 vendors were on hand on Saturday to serve food on the street, with many eateries setting up stalls outside their shops to draw people in. On Sunday, Cuba Street was transformed into a massive outdoor caf\u00e9 with resident eateries including Scopa, Ombra and Mattherhorn setting up tables on the street for the hungry festival-goers. CubaDupa, which is a retake on the former Cuba Street Carnival, is said to have cost about $500,000 to put on and will be funded for the next five years.

His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. It seems he survived by sheer willpower, said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued, she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? I was just lying down, she said. There was no room to move here and there. Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

The federation would no doubt toast Mrs May if she abandoned the whole idea.The home secretary told rank-and-file officers the murder of a police officer was a particularly appalling crime.We ask police officers to keep us safe by confronting and stopping violent criminals for us, she said.And sometimes you are targeted by criminals because of what you represent.She added: We are clear - life should mean life for anyone convicted of killing a police officer.The Criminal Justice Act 2003 permits Justice Secretary Chris Grayling - following consultation with the Sentencing Council - to make an order to change starting points for sentences.In this instance, it enables him to change the starting point from 30 years to a whole life order, meaning offenders could not be released other than at the discretion of the secretary of state on compassionate grounds - for example, if they are terminally ill or seriously incapacitated.The Sentencing Council, the official body that oversees sentencing in England and Wales, issues guidelines for judges and magistrates to work to for all offences other than murder.A spokesman said: Introducing whole life tariffs for those who murder police officers would involve changes to the law, which is a matter for Parliament, rather than the Sentencing Council.But he confirmed that the government had a duty to consult with the council before new legislation could be brought in.The Sentencing Council says that, as things stand, whole life orders can be imposed in murder cases if the court decides that the offence is so serious that the offender should spend the rest of their life in prison.There are currently 47 prisoners in England and Wales who have been given whole life tariffs, including Rosemary West and Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe.The home secretary, who faced a question and answer session after her speech, was heckled at last year's conference after she told officers to stop pretending they were being singled out and would have to make their share of public spending cuts.Police Federation chairman Steve Williams, who had earlier welcomed Mrs May's sentencing plan, told her morale was low as a result of the government's programme of cuts and reforms.Speaking at the conference, he urged the home secretary not to hang your reforms on the reprehensible behaviour of a handful of officers.The biggest applause came when he called for the government to abandon plans for compulsory severance, which are currently subject to negotiation.Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor, who is behind hotly debated changes such as fast-track recruitment and lower annual pay for new constables, was also due to address officers.On Tuesday, shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told the three-day conference that government plans to withdraw from the European Arrest Warrant agreement would make it harder to catch criminals who went on the run abroad.", "reference": "criminals who kill police officers in england and wales will face compulsory whole life sentences, home secretary theresa may has announced.", "sentences": ["the home secretary has said she wants to introduce new laws on the life of police officers convicted of crimes against humanity."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n{\"sentence\": \"the home secretary has said she wants to introduce new laws on the life of police officers convicted of crimes against humanity.\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'.And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience, added Tally Evans.There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996.Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted.Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape.Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion.There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas.In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted.A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a very unhappy man.I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted, Tally Evans said.I never saw my social worker again.The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart.Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.", "reference": "former james bond star sir roger moore has revealed how he was helped to reach the top in hollywood, in a new 10-minute film celebrating the olympics.", "sentences": ["this year\\'s london fringe festival is taking place in london."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"this year's london fringe festival is taking place in london.\",\n        \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\",\n        \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

At the end of last month, the young royal, who lives three and a half thousand miles away from her family in the UK, celebrated her 25th birthday. In the middle of a Palace function, her father, Prince Andrew, whipped out his iPad and used it to video call his daughter, who currently lives in Manhattan. The shop stocks trendy brands including Stella McCartney, Proenza Schouler, Missoni, J Brand and Chloe If that wasn\u2019t enough, the prince got his 400-strong audience in the State Apartments at St James\u2019s Palace to sing a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, accompanied by a trumpeter from the Scots Guards. The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James\u2019s Palace, saying: \u2018We are going to do something new this evening. \u2018The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it\u2019s her 25th birthday today.\u2019 Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved. Andrew told her: \u2018You will notice that we have somebody here to play (gesturing to the trumpeter).\u2019 He then turned to the lance corporal and added: \u2018If you will lead us in Happy Birthday please...\u2019 There were cheers from the crowd as the song came to an end, while plenty of others waved and tried to capture the moment on their camera phones. Eugenie looked delighted and said she was \u2018very proud, Pops\u2019 of her father\u2019s role in the awards, which celebrate innovation and technology in the creative industries. But the singalong did not impress his ex-wife, who joked - in the style of a Eurovision announcement - that the rendition scored \u2018zero points\u2019. The Duke of York holds an iPad as he invites the audience at the Pitch@Palace event to sing happy birthday via FaceTime to his daughter Princess Eugenie Sarah added: \u2018We think you all need to go for choir practice.\u2019 Andrew, however, was content with the gesture. \u2018Having been told this was a bad idea, it worked,\u2019 he said. The Prince, who used a Pitch@Palace event last year to send the first royal selfie, joked: \u2018\u2019What was it somebody said about children and dogs?\u2019 The social media-savy Royal is also the only senior working royal to have his own personal Twitter account.

Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti knows his side have plenty of reasons to be wary as they look to keep up the pressure on the leaders with victory over seventh-placed Malaga. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been ruled out of his side's La Liga match against Malaga Benzema rolls around on the floor during Real Madrid's quarter-final clash against rivals Atletico Real Madrid attacking midfielder Isco is expected to replace the injured Benzema for Saturday's clash Malaga pulled off a stunning 1-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp in June and Ancelotti has warned his players they must wipe thoughts of their Champions League semi-final against city rivals Atletico if they are to avoid a similar fate. Ancelotti, who is without the injured Karim Benzema, said: 'Malaga played very well against Atletico (last week), performing with a lot of intensity and quality. They beat Barcelona at home and we need to focus on this match in order to win it.' Atletico Madrid will look to consolidate their grip on third place as they travel to a Deportivo La Coruna side for whom two successive draws has left them sitting above the relegation zone on goal difference alone. James Rodriguez (left) is likely to play in a central attacking role alongside club team-mate Isco Gareth Bale (pictured) and Cristiano Ronaldo will be tasked with scoring goals in Benzema's absence Bale sprints ahead of Luka Modric during Friday's training session ahead of Real's clash against Malaga Also on Saturday, mid-table Athletic Bilbao look to return to winning ways after three games without a victory as they take on Getafe, for whom three games unbeaten have effectively ended relegation fears. Sunday's action switches to the relegation zone with Almeria looking to build on their potentially priceless win over Granada last week and put space between themselves and the drop zone with victory at Rayo Vallecano. Granada hunt for their first league win in six at home to Sevilla while bottom-placed Cordoba's survival hopes will be all but over if they fail to take the points at Europe-chasing Villarreal.

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse\u00a0Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost \u00a312,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The \u00a388,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one.

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable, the agency said in a written statement to CNN. All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable. But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim.

According to TMZ, the 50-year-old Food Network standout is 'heartbroken' about the split and his wife is 'mighty unhappy' with the prenup which is said to favor Bobby.

Done: Bobby Flay has filed for divorce from his wife of 10 years Stephanie March, TMZ reported on Friday; here the couple is pictured in June 2013 'I know Stephanie basically asked him after January Jones, Did you f*** her?' an insider told the site. March was said to be suspicious after her husband happened to be on the scene when single mother Jones got into a car accident in LA in 2010. The source added that he denied any romance. Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth. There was concern about this woman: The New York Daily News on Friday claimed that March asked her spouse if he had any romantic liaisons with January Jones - he allegedly said no; here Jones is pictured in March Her love interest these days:\u00a0Jones is now dating Will Forte, who she was seen with in February at the premiere of The Last Man On Earth Legal documents obtained by TMZ state that the marriage has 'broken down irretrievably.'

He has already moved out of their New York City apartment. The couple has secured their own attorneys and are discussing the terms of divorce, according to the news site. Once so close: Flay and March, who reportedly separated three weeks ago,  pictured in January 2013 TMZ went on to report that the marriage began to unravel over the past year and a half. Sources told TMZ that the union crumbled when Stephanie's appendix burst and Bobby didn't come to the hospital until the next day. Stephanie claimed, according to TMZ, that Bobby said 'he was busy with work' and instead sent his assistants to help her.

According to TMZ, Bobby attended a wine festival in Florida with his assistants instead. This will be Stephanie's first divorce and a third for Flay, whose two previous marriages both ended in divorce. In January, Flay was rumoured to be romantically involved with fellow chef Giada De Laurentiis after the 44-year-old Giada At Home star announced her split from her husband of 11 years, Todd Thompson. The Iron Chef Of America star and Giada were spotted having 'a festive dinner out together' at Cecconi's, in the private Soho Beach House, in Miami Beach on December 27, 2014, as People reported.

A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain.

The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in.

He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms.

One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.' Eiffel Tower touches\u00a0Van De Ven! This photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him Basically there! A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works!

A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver.

Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands.

The name refers to a Biblical passage dealing with the end of times. The remaining members of the Gaver family have been jailed, including an 11-year-old and 15-year-old who were sent to a juvenile detention facility.

One of the suspects, David Gaver, was shot in the abdomen but has since been released from hospital The Arizona Department of Public Safety, who are investigating the shooting, said it was sparked when a few members of the Gaver family went into the Walmart to use the bathroom, and one of the store employees followed them into the restroom. At least one member of the Gaver family shoved the female employee, which led to the store calling 911. When police arrived on the scene to investigate the incident, they found the Gavers in the parking lot where they had been living out of a large SUV for the past few days.

DPS spokesman Bart Graves says when the police arrived, the Gavers 'immediately' started attacking, according to AZ Central. Witness Louie Solano told KPHO that the fight 'looked like a riot in the middle of the parking lot'. 'Lots of screams. Just screeching noise, like unreal, unreal,' Solano said. 'During the course of the fight, we believe there was a struggle for the officer's gun,' Graves said. That's when three shots were fired, though it's not clear who had the gun at that point. Sgt Daniels was shot in the leg, while David Gaver was hit in the abdomen. A Walmart employee who came to the aid of police suffered a sprained arm and cuts in the fight. Other officers were treated for lacerations, bruises and a twisted ankle.

Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black.\u00a0Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an \u00c9douard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar FBI investigators have long said they believed organized crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms The FBI, pictured here in 2013, has actively offered a $5million reward to anyone who had information that led to the painting's safe return to the museum", "reference": "robert gentile was charged with selling a firearm to an undercover agent . but his attorney claims the arrest was a ruse to get gentile to talk about the 1990 boston art heist at the isabel stewart gardner museum . gentile 's house was searched in 2012 and police found a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value , as well as police uniforms . the half-a-billion heist remains unsolved and fbi has never come close to finding thieves . gardner museum continues to display empty frames , and is offering $ 5million reward for the return of the works .", "sentences": ["robert gentile claimed the arrest was a ruse to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in u.s. history .", "the man 's lawyer said the arrest is to pressure gentile .", "the fbi sketch shows the likeness of the suspects wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "NoE", "CorefE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"robert gentile claimed the arrest was a ruse to pressure him to talk about the biggest art heist in u.s. history .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"the man 's lawyer said the arrest is to pressure gentile .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"the fbi sketch shows the likeness of the suspects wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "no error", "entity error"]}

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act.

Packages containing heroin and cannabis were cleared from the roof of HMP Altcourse in Liverpool - hurled there from the outside by friends of inmates who missed their intended targets. The hydraulic crane also recovered so-called 'legal highs' as well as 22 phones, three Sim cards and six chargers from the 60ft roof, contained in a total of 14 bubble-wrapped packages. Officers at the jail, privately run by controversial firm G4S, disclosed the haul in an internal document, which dramatically highlights the extent of drug use among the jail's 1,300 inmates. Dave Thompson, director of the Category B prison, said: 'These items were thrown over the prison walls by criminals on the outside and it required a cherry picker and staff to retrieve them from inaccessible rooftops.' Altcourse, the first prison in the UK to be designed and constructed for a private operator, has been criticised for drug-related violence. After a three-day visit last June, chief inspector of prisons Chris Hardwick wrote: 'There have been 38 serious assaults in just four months before the inspection. Gang issues and the availability of drugs, particularly new psychoactive substances [legal highs] were a significant factor in much of the violence.' G4S insists that Altcourse runs an effective anti-smuggling operation, and that the cherry picker is part of a 'high-visibility' approach to show inmates they will 'root out packages from anywhere'. 'We are committed to preventing drugs coming into our prison and we are encouraged that, at the same time as our seizures of banned substances have increased, the numbers of prisoners testing positive for them has come down,' said Mr Thompson.", "reference": "a cherry picker was called in to clear drugs from roof of hmp altcourse . packages containing heroin and cannabis were hurled there from outside . the throwers missed their intended targets - their inmate friends inside .", "sentences": ["so-called legal highs ' legal highs ' are thrown over the fence into a prison .", "they were cleared from the roof of hmp UNK in liverpool .", "they were cleared from the roof of hmp UNK in liverpool .", "they were cleared from the roof of hmp UNK in liverpool ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"so-called legal highs ' legal highs ' are thrown over the fence into a prison .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"they were cleared from the roof of hmp UNK in liverpool .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"they were cleared from the roof of hmp UNK in liverpool .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"they were cleared from the roof of hmp UNK in liverpool .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "out-of-context error", "out-of-context error", "out-of-context error"]}

The royal, who was hosting the Pitch@Palace event for entrepreneurs, introduced the stunned audience to the singalong at St James\u2019s Palace, saying: \u2018We are going to do something new this evening. \u2018The lady in the middle is my youngest daughter and it\u2019s her 25th birthday today.\u2019 Laughing Eugenie, wearing a pair of novelty birthday candle glasses to mark the occasion, and accompanied by her sister, Princess Beatrice, and mother, Sarah, Duchess of York, smiled and waved.

The family's popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of Shannon spending time with convicted child molester Mark McDaniel. June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, has accused McDaniel of repeatedly abusing her when she was just a child. In the wake of the cancellation, Thompson's younger brother - Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson \u2013 revealed to The National Enquirer  that Shannon had indulged in a 'threesome' with Sugar Bear and older brother Billy back in 2007. 'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer\u00a0in December. 'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments.

Adebayor has one year left to run on his current contract at White Hart Lane, but his inconsistent form has led to few assurances over his future. Maverick Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor performs a strange dance in front of the Arc de Triomphe The Togo international posted the video of him dancing in front of the Paris landmark on his Instagram account He joined Spurs in 2011 from Manchester City, initially on loan before an impressive first season tally of 18 goals, convinced the club to make the switch permanent for \u00a35million the following summer. Since then, however, Adebayor's goal return has become significantly more modest and he has not scored in the league for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat to Newcastle back in October. Factor in the remarkable rise of academy graduate Harry Kane and it is easy to see why some sections of supporters have written Adebayor off as surplus to requirements.

They host Rangers on Tuesday with Sherwood admitting he does not have the players to grind out results. Victory would move Villa five points clear of the Barclays Premier League drop zone but they will return to the bottom three if QPR, three points behind with a better goal difference, win. And Sherwood underlined the magnitude of the game ahead of the showdown. Tim Sherwood (from left to right), Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey during their time at White Hart Lane Sherwood (right) sits on the bench with Tottenham Hotspur staff Ferdinand (centre) and Ramsey (left) Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor celebrates his goal by saluting Sherwood (right) and Ramsey (centre) 'I think this is the biggest game that a lot of these players have ever played for this football club,' he said, with Villa in 17th. 'This is without doubt the biggest game of the season for Villa and possibly one of the biggest in a number of years. 'This is the biggest (of my managerial career).' But the boss believes he must instil a different mentality into his players as he tries to keep them in the top flight. 'We've got different types of players, you look through QPR's side and they've got a lot of players who are men - with a lot of experience in there,' he said. 'We've got a few men in there - but we've got a lot of pretty much icing-on-the-cake players and I'm trying to get that mentality into them to forget about digging out results. It's not what we're cut out to do. 'I haven't identified many players who can't cope with the pressure, but you don't know until they get out there.' Sherwood is without Alan Hutton, Ashley Westwood and Scott Sinclair while Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Aly Cissokho are doubts. Sherwood faces his friend and former Tottenham assistant, QPR boss Chris Ramsey, for the first time since they both left Spurs last summer. Sherwood and Ramsey forged their friendship at Tottenham and remain close ahead of their showdown The bond between the two remains strong even if Sherwood is blocking Ramsey's mobile phone calls for now Sherwood hinted that if Ramsey's tenure at Loftus Road ends, then he would ask to bring him to Villa Park Ramsey has admitted his job at Rangers could be under threat if they get relegated and, while he admitted Ramsey may prefer to be a manager, Sherwood left the door open for a reunion at Villa. He added: 'If there was ever an opportunity for me to work with him again I would do that. 'I would have to speak to the club about whether we could find a role for him here.

Adversity sometimes brings out the best in people, although nerves did seem to take effect after half-time.Foran has said for some time his side just needed one win to get going. They have it and look capable of more as the pressure turns, at least temporarily, to sides above.Tansey, who has agreed a pre-contract to join Aberdeen, was at the heart of the Saturday lunchtime victory. It was his delivery that found McKay ghosting in and the defender's finish was perfect.Another Tansey delivery was rewarded when Donati wrestled Draper to the ground. Tansey took the responsibility and delivered under pressure.In truth, Inverness could have been out of sight by the break.Billy Mckay should have done better from close range twice and Alex Fisher somehow screwed a header wide from a few yards after Remi Matthews had parried Tansey's drive.And, in the second period, Scott Boden could have sealed the win when clean through but dinked over.Martin Canning's side improved significantly after the break as Crawford and Redmond were sent on in place of Donati and Rakish Bingham.And Crawford thought he had earned a lifeline. As Gary Warren tried to shepherd the ball out, Esson came flying out and inexplicably took the substitute down.Referee Andrew Dallas did not point to the spot, leaving Hamilton players in disbelief. It was a huge escape for the home side.Having offered little earlier in the match, other than a great chance for Darian MacKinnon which he prodded wide, the second-half response was firm.Dougie Imrie, Crawford and Greg Docherty all came close but ultimately they did not threaten enough and gave themselves too much to do after leaving themselves repeatedly exposed in defence.Redmond's late finish was little consolation, although the goal may yet have an important part to play in the final make-up of goal difference with so few points separating the sides.Match ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.Second Half ends, Inverness CT 2, Hamilton Academical 1.Goal!

I\u2019m fortunate I was put into this position at a great club. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity. \u2018But I\u2019ve said all along, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about players. If they perform, you get a better reputation as a manager and that has been the case here with a great response from them. \u2018That\u2019s how football works. If they play well, your stock rises. Equally, if they don\u2019t play well, it\u2019s the manager who gets the stick. \u2018I\u2019ve got broad shoulders and I know what to expect but I can\u2019t praise the players highly enough. They have worked so hard and they have taken on board everything I have tried to tell them.\u2019 Ex-Killie and Hearts player Locke, who was crestfallen not to be retained by the Tynecastle club as head coach after they were relegated last season, added: \u2018(Coaches) Alan Robertson and Billy Thomson have done a fantastic job in helping me, too. \u2018You can\u2019t do all of these things by yourself and backroom staff can be as important as the players. I can\u2019t thank all of these people enough.\u2019 Locke, who returned to Rugby Park last summer, had been working as No 2 under Johnston when the manager announced in February that he would be leaving the club at the end of the season, indicating that the \u00a3150,000 sale of teenage forward Robbie Muirhead to Dundee United had been a factor in his decision. After Johnston was immediately relieved of his duties by the club hierarchy, assistant Locke was put in charge and was initially regarded as a stop-gap appointment. But he quickly won over the players and a team that had previously been struggling in the league went unbeaten in their first six games under his stewardship. They only suffered their first reverse under Locke when Ross County beat them 2-1 in Dingwall two weeks ago. Kilmarnock went unbeaten during Locke's first six games in charge of the club He has impressed Mann not only with results but with the way he has conducted himself during his two months at the helm. Kilmarnock are currently eighth in the Premiership and still remain in the hunt for a top-six place. It was expected that Locke would have been appointed permanently before now, but he dismissed reports that talks had stalled due to a clause that would see him sacked if the club failed to achieve a top-six finish this season. \u2018When you are dealing with contracts, they take a bit of time and I certainly don\u2019t foresee any problems,\u2019 he said. \u2018There hasn\u2019t really been a hold-up. As any player or manager will tell you, when it comes to the terms of a contract, it doesn\u2019t just happen overnight. There are a lot of things to discuss and I have done that. \u2018I will keep all that private because that is the way it should be and the club have dealt with it brilliantly. \u2018I\u2019ve no complaints there, so I hope it will be sorted before Saturday and I can concentrate on our home game against Motherwell. \u2018Our new board of directors have been fantastic. I\u2019ve been really impressed with the way that they have handled everything. The club itself is trying to be as positive as possible. \u2018There are a lot of plans in place to make the club even better than it is right now, so there are loads of positives and I would like to be part of that.\u2019 Having resolved his own situation, Locke will next week turn his attention to the futures of nine first-team players at Kilmarnock \u2014 Manuel Pascali, Alexei Eremenko, Craig Slater, Craig Samson, Sammy Clingan, Greg Kiltie, Conor Brennan, Chris Chantler and Mark O\u2019Hara \u2014 who will become free agents this summer. \u2018I\u2019ve said for a number of weeks now that once my own position was sorted out, there are a few players out of contract and they will want to know what their futures are,\u2019 he said. \u2018So it will be great to get moving on all of that and prepare for next season. \u2018You can\u2019t do that until you are the main man.\u2019", "reference": "gary locke will be confirmed as kilmarnock boss on friday . the club went unbeaten during locke 's first six games in charge . the 39-year-old former killie defender has paid tribute to his players .", "sentences": ["gary locke will be confirmed as UNK permanent manager on friday .", "the former hearts boss was given a three-year deal at the club .", "locke paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"gary locke will be confirmed as UNK permanent manager on friday .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"the former hearts boss was given a three-year deal at the club .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"locke paid tribute to the players whose efforts have helped him win favour .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "out-of-context error", "no error"]}

Alison Hargreaves, 32, was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995. Now her son Tom Ballard, one of the world's most accomplished climbers, plans to conquer K2 himself. Mr Ballard, 26, told The Times\u00a0that he saw it as his destiny to follow in his mother's footsteps. He said: 'I think it must be. At one stage I thought I would go and climb mountains for her. Then I realised that was actually a bit stupid because she had already climbed them herself. I realised I was climbing for myself. That's how I've gone on.' Last month Mr Ballard became the first to solo climb all six of the great north faces of the Alps in the winter season - and now he is training for K2. The climber was just six years old when his mother died while descending K2, which is regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top. Days before her death, Mrs Hargreaves sent a fax to her son and his sister Katie. It read: 'Tom and Katie, We have arrived at our base camp. The trek was difficult \u2014 it snowed every day. The mountain I have come to climb is called K2.' Attached was a drawing of the 28,251ft mountain which would later claim her life. Mr Ballard's mother was a revered figure in the climbing world and was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen. Alison Hargreaves (pictured with Tom and his sister Katie as children) was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalalayn mountain in 1995 K2 is\u00a0regarded as more difficult to reach than the summit of Mount Everest, with dozens dying during attempts to reach the top Mrs Hargreaves, pictured with her husband Jim and thier family, was only the second person to climb Everest without sherpas or bottled oxygen Tragic: Mr Ballard was just six years old when his mother died on her way down from the summit of K2 Her decision to take on dangerous climbs while raising a young family was criticised by some, but she shrugged off the flak, saying that fathers who went climbing did not face the same scrutiny. When she climbed the north face of the Eiger, in the Swiss Alps, in 1988, Mrs Hargreaves was pregnant with her son. Mr Ballard said he had clear memories of clambering over rocks as a child and had always known climbing was his calling. 'When I grew, I was always scrambling around on little rocks underneath the crags where my mum and dad climbed. A child, playing,' he said. 'At primary school I had something like an epiphany. Suddenly I decided that all I wanted to do with my life was just to climb. Since then that's pretty much all I have done.'", "reference": "alison hargreaves , 32 , was killed in 1995 as she descended from k2 . now her son tom ballard plans to conquer treacherous mountain himself . his mother was swept to her death by 260mph winds atop the mountain . at 28,251 ft , k2 is considered more difficult to climb than mount everest .", "sentences": ["Tom Ballard plans to climb K2 , 20 years after his mother died descending from its peak .", "Alison Hargreaves , 32 , was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995 .", "Now her son Mr Ballard , 26 , plans to conquer K2 himself ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"Tom Ballard plans to climb K2 , 20 years after his mother died descending from its peak .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"Alison Hargreaves , 32 , was swept to her death in 260mph winds on her descent from the Himalayan mountain in 1995 .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"Now her son Mr Ballard , 26 , plans to conquer K2 himself .\", \"reason\": \"predicate error\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["coreference error", "entity error", "predicate error"]}

His survival is unusual, as experts say it's rare for injured people who are trapped to hold out for longer than 72 hours after a disaster. The man, Rishi Khanal, was saved after a French search and rescue team found him under the rubble on the outskirts of Kathmandu, the capital, around noon Tuesday, said Pushparam K.C., a spokesman for the Armed Police Force of Nepal. The team used specialized gear that detects signs of life, he said. But it took about 10 more hours for the French team and police officers to dig him out, the spokesman said. A police video of the rescue showed the teams drilling through concrete to reach Khanal's location and then hauling him up through the hole. They then carried him out of the ruined building on a stretcher. On Wednesday afternoon, Khanal, 27, had just undergone surgery and was resting, surrounded by family and friends. He had suffered a crushed foot and was too weak and distraught to talk about his traumatic experience. It seems he survived by sheer willpower, said Akhilesh Shrestha, a doctor who treated Khanal, according to the Reuters news agency. Khanal's story of survival isn't the only one to emerge from the terrible destruction wrought by the quake, which has killed more than 5,000 people. A 4-month-old baby was rescued from a destroyed building in the town of Bhaktapur at least 22 hours after the quake struck, the newspaper Kathmandu Today reported. A Nepali military team had failed to notice the child during its search but returned after his cry was heard, the newspaper said. The little boy, whose name is Sonit Awal, was reported to be in stable condition without any internal injuries, according to initial examinations. CNN hasn't independently confirmed Sonit's rescue, but the newspaper published photos showing the dust-caked infant being lifted by Nepali soldiers in the ruined structure. Tanka Maya Sitoula, a 40-year-old mother of four, was at home in Kathmandu when the earthquake shook the city, bringing the five-story building down around her ground-floor apartment. She endured 36 long hours trapped in a room before an Indian rescue team freed her. She escaped without injury, apparently protected by a beam. Sitoula says she remained confident she would survive amid the rubble. I heard people making noise outside, so I thought I would be rescued, she said, as she and her family sheltered on the grounds of a nearby school. What did she do for 36 hours? I was just lying down, she said. There was no room to move here and there. Sitoula's husband, Mahendra, a butcher, said he called out for help for hours after the quake, as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building. It took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived, he said. And it took another 18 hours to free her. Jon Keisi was buried for more than 60 hours under the wreckage of a seven-story building in Kathmandu that came tumbling down around him during the quake. Rescue workers flown in from Turkey had to help carve a tunnel deep into the debris to reach him. Encased in an orange stretcher, he was lifted to safety Tuesday. But he cried out in pain after his rescuers set him down, shaking his head from side to side. One of the hard-hat-wearing search team members that crowded around him called for water. Keisi was injured and dehydrated, but the rescuers said they were confident he would survive. CNN's Elizabeth Joseph reported from Kathmandu, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

One of the men 38-year-old Lianna Barrientos wed was deported back to Pakistan for making threatening statements against the United States in 2006 after an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force, it has been revealed. Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from\u00a0Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to\u00a0The New York Daily News. At one time she was married to eight men simultaneously. Always the bride:\u00a0Liana Barrientos, 39, of the Bronx, pleaded not guilty on Friday to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences Sullen: Barrientos, seen here in Bronx Supreme Court on Friday, is accused of marrying 10 men over the course of 11 years in an apparent immigrant scam Charged: The Bronx district attorney's office says she faces two counts of felony fraud charges Swindle: Barrientos is accused of accepting money in at least one of the marriages, prosecutors say All of her marriages took place in New York state, allegedly starting in 1999. Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali,\u00a0- \u00a0the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC. 'If someone could remarry 10 times without bringing it to the attention of the authorities, potentially an al-Qaeda plant could come in, marry this woman and be in this country illegally, plotting, recruiting, perhaps even executing a terrorist attack.'

Her first marriage took place in 1999, with most recent being in 2010 Barrientos' marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril The bride and her grooms: This map shows Barrientos' marriages from 1999 to 2010 Barrientos' first marriage took place in 1999 to Mohamed Gerbril, followed by a 2001 marriage to Ahmed Allam, then a second 2001 marriage to Habibur Rahman, the Post reported. According to the newspaper, Barrientos married six men in 2002 - namely Davit Koridze, Duran Goktepe, Aliaksandr Paharelau, Vakhtang Dzneladze, Rashid Rajput, and Kakhaber Khorbaladze - and her last marriage was in 2010 to Salle Keita. Authorities reportedly slapped her with offering a false instrument for filing felony charges in November 2014. Quoting court documents,\u00a0The New York Daily News\u00a0said '[Barrientos] ... stated in sum and substance that she did marry Mr. Keita and that was her first and only marriage.' The newspaper reported that Barrientos could be sentenced to a total of eight years stemming from her two charges. Barrientos has been arrested multiple times, including for loitering, drug possession, and jumping a turnstile and trespassing, according to the Daily News. Mystery: The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office told the New York Times According to the New York Times, '[Barrientos] has divorced at least four times, from husbands Nos. 1, 2, 5 and 7, but long after marrying husbands 3 through 9.' The Times reported that for her first three 2002 marriages, Barrientos wed Koridze on Valentine's Day, before she went on to marry Goktepe approximately two weeks later, then soon tied the knot with Paharelau. The Department of Homeland Security was 'involved' in Barrientos' case, the Bronx district attorney's office revealed to the Times. Barrientos' Facebook profile says she hails from the Dominican Republic and lives in Manhattan. It also says she became engaged in July 2013. Wedding bells?

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names.

These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable, the agency said in a written statement to CNN. All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable. But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim.

Net immigration will steadily increase over the next 45 years, totaling at 64million Without no change in current immigration policy, by 2023 the total immigrant population in the United states will reach 14.8 per cent, the highest ever recorded in American history Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population and will reach 15.8 per cent of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent by 2060 In 1990, immigrants accounted for just 7.9 per cent of U.S. population U.S population could grow to 417million by 2016. In 2010 the population was 306million Without a change to immigration policty, immigrants who arrive in the future and their descendants could account for three quarters of future U.S. population Center for Immigration Studies This could potentially exempt about five million undocumented immigrants from deportation. And with the surge in immigrant population, Republican presidential candidates have to figure out what their stance is on the subject as potential new policies could be established. CIS director of research Steven Camarota said that the growth in immigrant population has 'important implications for workers, schools, infrastructure, congestion and the environment'. 'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million) \u00a0by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which\u00a0could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner.

If anything, they've been better than they were last season. With Rangers in the league, with a stronger Hearts team, they've still been the second-top team in Scotland and I think Derek and his players deserve enormous credit for that.Media playback is not supported on this deviceEven if Rangers were to win (on Sunday), I don't think they will finish second. Aberdeen have been so consistent, especially at home, so I fully expect Rangers to lose.The Dons have made Pittodrie a fortress this season, embarking on a 10-game winning streak on their home patch.They may have been eased aside by all-conquering Celtic in November's League Cup final, but have the chance to reach another national showpiece when they face Hibernian in the Scottish Cup last four on 22 April.Derek can't win the league, not against this Celtic side, Thompson added. Success can be measured in other ways. To reach both cup finals would be success in itself, to finish second, to get European football again, to break records - I'm not sure what else he can do.The consistency they've shown in the last two seasons has been phenomenal. I just think there aren't enough plaudits out there for Derek McInnes and the work he's done.Meanwhile, former Rangers player Thompson admits he has been baffled by the actions of new Ibrox boss, Pedro Caixinha.The Portuguese took the unusual step of revealing his team line-up a day before Wednesday's goalless draw with Kilmarnock, and two days ahead of their showdown with the Dons predicted the starting XI McInnes would select.Media playback is not supported on this deviceFor me, it's nonsensical to give the opposition your team, Thompson said. It gives them extra time to prepare, and insight into how they're going to go about beating your side.I've never worked under a manager who would consider giving away his team lines, let alone a day before like he did. I found that puzzling.Possibly even more puzzling was to name the Aberdeen team. I think he's trying to show he's done his homework, but you can pretty much name the Aberdeen team because it doesn't change too often.If I was Derek McInnes, what would I think of that? Is it mind games? It's not very good mind games, if you ask me.Thompson, who made over 60 appearances for Rangers, says Caixinha's carefree style sits in stark contrast with the rigidity and structure of his predecessor, Mark Warburton.The 46-year-old led the Gers to a thumping win over Hamilton Academical in his first game in charge, but has since dropped points with successive draws against Motherwell and Kilmarnock.It's far too early to be making judgements, Thompson asserted. None of these players are Caixinha's players. I suspect in the summer you'll see a substantial recruitment drive.One thing that struck me is he's not afraid to do something radical. I know he had injury problems, but he took off three of his back-four, completely changed his shape against Motherwell. That raised a few eyebrows, although they got back into the game.Caixinha looks like he's going to start taking risks. With that, you have to make sure you're getting results as well. It won't happen this season, but if he continues to take risks like he does and he isn't getting results next season, it won't be long before he receives criticism.", "reference": "derek mcinnes deserves more praise for his achievements at aberdeen, says ex-scotland striker steven thompson.", "sentences": ["derek mcinnes believes rangers can win the scottish cup again this season."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"derek mcinnes believes rangers can win the scottish cup again this season.\",\n        \"reason\": \"entity error - Derek McInnes is the Aberdeen manager, not Rangers.\",\n        \"category\": \"entity error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

Their recent success can probably be explained by a number of reasons. Players have returned from injury at the right time, Olivier Giroud can't stop scoring, Hector Bellerin and Francis Coquelin have emerged, while Arsene Wenger seems to have found his drive once again. But could there be something else? With the Gunners preparing for the Premier League trip to Burnley on Saturday, one of their partners Europcar have revealed how some of the first-team stars motivate themselves on the team bus with some interesting and uncharacteristic selections included. Arsenal players have revealed their ultimate pre-game playlist ahead of their Premier League tie with Burnley Olivier Giroud selected Coldplay's 'Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall' as his selected track For instance, who would have guessed Giroud was a Coldplay fan? And can you picture Laurent Koscielny nodding along to Pharrell Williams' hit 'Happy' before defending at Turf Moor? And that's not all. Nacho Monreal opts for Dance DJ legend David Guetta's lead single from his sixth album 'Dangerous', David Ospina will even find time for some Colombian rap with J Balvin's track 'Tranquila' pre-game. Santi Cazorla has been in sparkling form in recent months with his languid style of creating from deep. So it is perhaps no surprise that the Spanish playmaker opts for something a bit softer - with pop singer from his homeland Melendi giving the 30-year-old all he needs before setting foot off the bus. Cazorla's track choice may be slightly more old school, but that's nothing compared to Theo Walcott. The England forward is obviously Loungin' before games with his selection of LL Cool J's 1996 summer hip-hop tune, which doesn't quite posses the fast pace we expect from Walcott on the pitch. Santi Cazorla's style of music seems to suit him - selecting Spanish pop star Melendi's slow track Nacho Monreal appears to be a fan of up-beat dance music, opting for David Guetta track 'Dangerous' Laurent Koscielny may prepare for defending at Turf Moor by listening to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers, Danny Welbeck, Aaron Ramsey and Kieran Gibbs are the youngest players on the list, so it is perhaps no surprise they go for recent and more mainstream hits. Phillip George's house track 'Wish You Were Mine', Macklemore's smash record 'Can't Hold Us', 'End Credits by drum and bass duo Chase and Status (ft Plan B), the Arctic Monkeys' indie toe-tapper 'Arabella' and Royal Blood's 'Figure It Out' are there respective selections. The light-hearted activity is designed to bring fans closer to their heroes, giving an insight into day in the life of a Premier League footballer before an important game. 'As Arsenal's official car and van rental partner, we wanted to bring travelling fans closer to their heroes so they can be inspired by the player's ultimate playlist which will get them fired up for another important game this weekend,' explained Ken McCall, Managing Director, Europcar UK Group. 'It's certainly an eclectic playlist. 'We wish Arsenal the very best of luck in the match.' Burnley are desperate for three points at the bottom of the table, while the Gunners are looking to keep their faint title chances alive with a win in the Saturday evening fixture.

Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said. 'We want to play to a game plan, execute well and perform to the best of our ability. To do justice to the league we have to do that. 'Glasgow are a good offloading side, they are a complete side in many ways, and we've got to control the ball better than we did last weekend.'", "reference": "the glasgow duo have played nearly 300 games between them . al kellock and dougie hall will both retire at the end of the season . glasgow face cardiff blues at scotstoun on friday night .", "sentences": ["UNK and hall will start at lock against cardiff blues at UNK .", "UNK and hall will start at lock against cardiff blues at UNK .", "UNK and hall will start at lock against cardiff blues at UNK ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "EntE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "EntE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"UNK and hall will start at lock against cardiff blues at UNK .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"UNK and hall will start at lock against cardiff blues at UNK .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"UNK and hall will start at lock against cardiff blues at UNK .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["coreference error", "coreference error", "coreference error"]}

Then there is the inevitable speculation over the future of under-fire manager Manuel Pellegrini. But the biggest challenge for Manchester City this summer could be keeping hold of something they already have. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero looks on dejected during the defeat by United at Old Trafford The afternoon started so well for Aguero and City when he opened the scoring after just eight minutes Aguero celebrates his 99th goal for Manchester City with David Silva as De Gea looks dejected It may have gone largely unnoticed in the carnage at Old Trafford but there was an important landmark for the brilliant Sergio Aguero that deserves to be recognised. The aftermath of a crushing derby defeat at the old enemy may not be the place for jelly and ice-cream but the Argentine's tremendous feat of scoring 100 goals in just 158 appearances should be cause for celebration. Take a minute to think where City would have been without that century. Remember THAT title-winning goal against QPR in 2012? Most, in that situation, would have put their foot through the ball as soon as it arrived from Mario Balotelli. Not Kun. The man who takes his nickname from a cartoon character had City fans believing in fairy tales when he feigned a shot to open up space before firing home probably the biggest goal in the club's long history. That calm head, that powerful shot and that unnerving ability to find the target are what City paid what now looks like a bargain \u00a338m for in 2011. Aguero netted his 100th goal for City in the 89th minute but there was no cause for celebration The Argentine strikes in injury time against QPR to win Manchester City the title in 2012 Aguero celebrates with Edin Dzeko after that goal when City scored twice in injury time to win title Aguero is settled in Manchester and signed a new five-year deal only last August. However, he now has to think of himself. If the unthinkable happens and City slip outside the top four will one of the best players in the world be happy at a season without showcasing his talents on the Champions League stage? There are admirers. Real Madrid and Barcelona are both fans. Should either register an interest City would face a desperate battle to keep hold of their star man. While a move to Madrid may come with an enticing caveat in the shape of Gareth Bale, the loss of Aguero would be exceptionally difficult to recover from. Where else do you get those goals from? While it is too early in his City career to pass judgement it would appear that the burden would be too much for Wilfried Bony's broad shoulders. Wilfried Bony has only scored once in five appearances since joining City from Swansea in January City's ageing squad is in need of a major overhaul in the summer Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is a potential target as the City owner prepares to open the cheque book The former Swansea City man, who cost just \u00a310m less than Aguero, has failed to hit the ground running since his January move and has scored only once in five appearances. The powers-that-be would no doubt have to open their chequebook but who would come to an Aguero-less City? And, should they sleepwalk out of the top four, who would dream of coming to a club without Champions League football? The likes of Paul Pogba and Raheem Sterling are potential targets. Sportsmail understands discussions have already taken place with a number of new additions. But will they also want to come to a club shorn of its idol? It is a big question and one that City will be desperate not to have to discover the answer to. Liverpool contract rebel Raheem Sterling could also be on any list of summer targets Manuel Pellegrini is facing the sack even if Manchester City qualify for the Champions League There are others to ponder. Does Pellegrini stay? And what share of the blame do executives Ferran Soriano and Txiki Begiristain take? Are they at fault for spending the best part of \u00a3200m since 2012 without really strengthening the team or does Pellegrini carry the can? With Financial Fair Play sanctions hurting, it was essential that City got bang for the buck. In reality they barely had a whimper.

The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

But the Dens Park bad boy will miss two forthcoming games against former club Celtic because he is under house arrest. The 27-year-old has been placed on a 16-week restriction of liberty order which confines him to home between the hours of 7pm and 7am. And the Dark Blues face Ronny Deila's night next Wednesday night \u2013 before a Friday night trip to Parkhead on May 1. McGowan was handed his third conviction for assaulting a police officer at Airdrie Sheriff Court. As a St Mirren player he was sentenced to 130 hours of unpaid work and handed a one-year supervision order in January 2014 after admitting kicking two officers. The court heard McGowan 'charged towards' two police officers after a disturbance in Airdrie in the early hours of November 23 last year. He later kicked another officer on the body while being detained at Coatbridge police station. Paul McGowan avoided a prison sentence after a third assault on a policeman Sheriff Derek O'Carroll spared the Dens star a prison sentence after hearing he had was undergoing counselling through PFA Scotland, the players' union, for a gambling problem in addition to social work sessions. In a statement Dundee vowed to support their player through his problems saying: 'The club does not condone the behaviour which has led to this and wouldn't from any member of our staff. 'We fully respect the decision made by the court and Dundee FC will be standing by the player. 'Paul is an integral part of the club and we will be working alongside the PFA with him as he bids to positively resolve his off the field issues. 'With the support of his manager, his teammates and club staff we hope Paul will be able to move forward and be part of another successful season next year at Dens Park. 'The club will be making no further comment on the matter.' His solicitor, Liam O'Donnell, told the court that social work reports 'finally give some indication that the accused is getting it in terms of his offending. He added: 'He was not in any trouble from the age of 16 to 23. At age 23 he separated from his partner. The reason he separated has been attributed to an underlying gambling problem. The 27-year-old Dundee midfielder pictured in action against Dundee United last week 'This gambling problem seems to be the root of his offending. When he takes alcohol his anger about the gambling problem seems to come out through aggression.' O'Donnell revealed the former St Mirren player was undergoing voluntary counselling each week through the Paisley-based RCA Trust, which helps people with alcohol and gambling addictions. 'He is fully supported by his club,' he added. 'The managing director of Dundee Football Club is present in court to indicate his support because he is addressing matters.' After listening to the address, Sheriff O'Carroll reminded McGowan of the previous occasions he had been convicted of offences, in 2010 and 2013. 'And here you are again facing similar charges,' O'Carroll added. 'It's quite correct to say that you are on the cusp of custody and certainly that's in the thoughts of the court.' However, he proceeded to sentence McGowan to the tagging order provided he continues with the counselling. 'If you breach the order you will be brought back here and I have already advised you what the outcome will be,' the sheriff added. Dundee managing director John Nelms, who was accompanied in court by players including captain James McPake, declined to answer questions outside court. McGowan also declined to comment but O'Donnell said afterwards: 'He is relieved with the outcome and he knows he needs to modify his behaviour. He appreciates the support of his club and others.'

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance. To do anything else would risk disenfranchising a section of that support. \u2018The issue of food banks and food poverty should not be used in a game of political football when the statistical evidence is so potentially misleading. We congratulate the Trussell Trust on the success of their operation but we also believe that successive governments have ignored the issue of waste in the food cycle. \u2018It is high time the OFB model of food bank \u2013 which prevents food being wasted and combats food poverty \u2013 is encouraged and replicated elsewhere.\u2019", "reference": "the trussell trust counted the number of people visiting its 445 branches . the charity hands out three-day food parcels to people requiring help . critics claim that people will come forward if free food is on offer . tories said getting people working was better than providing hand-outs .", "sentences": ["figures from trussell trust seized on by labour and tuc as ` shocking ' evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , and stopped benefits .", "tory benefits chief iain duncan smith questioned best way to help families was to get people into work .", "trussel trust claimed 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in glasgow ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "RelE", "GramE", "LinkE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"figures from trussell trust seized on by labour and tuc as ` shocking ' evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay , and stopped benefits .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"tory benefits chief iain duncan smith questioned best way to help families was to get people into work .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"trussel trust claimed 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in glasgow .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "no error", "out-of-context error"]}

Obesity levels were the main factor pushing the UK down the health rankings. With figures showing that almost one in four of the population is obese, Britain was 111th out of 133 countries on that specific measure. Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting us outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world. Britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table, put together by a Harvard Business School academic, looking at a range of living standards Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th. Professor Michael Porter of Harvard Business School, who headed the research, said: \u2018A striking finding is that gross domestic product is far from being the sole determinant of social progress.\u2019", "reference": "britain ranks as just 27th best country in the world for health and wellness . obesity levels were the main factor pushing britain down in health ranking . study shows uk came 11th in countries with high standards of prosperity .", "sentences": ["britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table .", "overall , the uk came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance .", "the uk has 11th in table of prosperity for health ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"britain has been ranked only the 27th best country in the world for health and wellness in an international league table .\", \"reason\": \"entity error - 'Britain' is incorrectly used instead of 'UK'\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"overall , the uk came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity , health and tolerance .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"the uk has 11th in table of prosperity for health .\", \"reason\": \"predicate error - 'has' should be 'ranked'\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "no error", "predicate error"]}

Compensation for such claims is unlimited. A statement on the agency's website states: It is almost politically incorrect to request someone to work for you that is both attractive as well as professionally equipped with the right set of skills.However, our company understands the importance of having the right people representing your company, because after all, first impressions count.But Ms Hilsenrath said: Matching Models are right about one thing; first impressions count, but the important stuff is not about your hair colour.If they wish to maintain their reputation, they should act like a business in the 21st Century and consign this type of sexism to the history books.Under the 2010 Equality Act, it is against the law to say, or imply, that you will discriminate against anyone - including saying that you are unable to cater for disabled workers.Employers are also not allowed to question a candidate's age, sexual orientation, marital status, number of children or plans to have children, disability, race or religion.As for specifying clothing sizes, an employer has to be able to show that it is essential to the nature or context of the work.Talking about the personal assistant advert, Ms Jansen said: The client who wants the specific cup size is an older gentleman - he has a specific outfit he designed with Christian Dior. He wants a Jackie O look. And he wants a lady with a smaller cup size to fit into the outfit.I recently had an Indian businessman who interviewed 60 women from my firm. He wanted a blonde, blue eyed, Greek woman. He hired 6 of them to work on his plane.Matching Models clients include MTV, Louis Vuitton, Coca-Cola, the Renualt Formula 1 team and Harrods.Ms Jansen said she had hired 5,000 people worldwide and pointed out MTV wanted models with tattoos and piercings.", "reference": "a recruitment agency has been criticised for advertising jobs only for ``attractive women\\'\\', as well as specifying bra size.", "sentences": ["the women\\'s equality commission ( ehrc ) has criticised the company behind its controversial  sexism  campaign."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n{\"sentence\": \"the women's equality commission ( ehrc ) has criticised the company behind its controversial  sexism  campaign.\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

The goal of the game, according to Investopedia.com, is to bluff the opponents into believing that your bid does not exceed the combined sum of all of the serial numbers. Collins reported that Paul and Blizerian were playing with $100 bills. Liar's Poker is also the title of a book by bestselling author Michael Lewis about the dissolute, everything-goes culture of Wall Street bond salesmen in the 1980s. Blizerian is a renowned professional poker player and self-described international playboy who has amassed 8million followers on his Instagram page, where he documents his globe-trotting, hard-partying lifestyle. Odd couple: There does not appear to be much overlap between the married 52-year-old doctor-turned-lawmaker and the 34-year-old globe-trotting, hard-partying playboy THAT video:\u00a0Blizerian made headlines last year when this video was released showing him hurling an 18-year-old porn star from the roof of his mansion into the pool Gun lover: In December, the former Navy SEAL trainee was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport for allegedly trying to manufacture a bomb In a profile published in the Wall Street Journal in 2014, Blizerian estimated earning about $50miillion in poker winnings in just over a year. Most of the images on his social media account feature young, attractive women in various states of undress, stacks of cash, yachts, supercars and wild clothing-optional parties. The poker champ and one-time Navy SEAL trainee also has been known to share with his fans pictures of his large weapons collection, which he lovingly refers to as his \u2018accessories.\u2019 Blizerian made headlines last year when a video was released showing him hurling an 18-year-old porn star from the roof of his mansion into the pool, leaving her with a broken foot.

The 55-year-old also revealed he has a fully fit squad to choose from on Tuesday evening with Welsh attacker Gareth Bale set to return to the first team after missing Madrid's 3-0 victory against Eibar on Saturday. 'I am lucky to have the whole squad at my disposal. The formation will be the same as always. 'To play well, we will have to use all our weapons: individual quality and attacking directly with pace.

Realising that its tongue is stuck to the frozen beef steak, the fly begins squirming in its attempts to break free Moving its legs, the fly at first attempts to walk away, before arching its back and trying with all its might to pull itself free. It tries this two more times, but much to its annoyance it stays attached to the beef steak as it stops to look at the camera.

The Midlands city topped the league table for the highest number of rat exterminations with almost 15,000 between 2013 and 2014. Newcastle is officially the most pest-infested place in the country with 5 per cent of those living on Tyneside reporting problems with rats, cockroaches, wasps and other creepy crawlies. The North East city was followed by the City of London where 4.9 per cent of people reported problems, and in Knowsley, Merseyside, 3.4 per cent of residents were forced to call in exterminators. Scroll down for video A survey revealed Birmingham to be the rat capital of the UK while the London Borough of Southwark has the most mice, cockroaches and bed bugs Five per cent of residents in Newcastle, more than 6,000 people, called in pest inspectors last year - making Tyneside residents the most likely to report a problem (file image) The figures, released by the British Pest Control Association, also revealed that the most pest-free place was Southend, in Essex, where 0.03 per cent of homeowners had a problem. Officials at the BPCA warned that pests numbers are at their highest levels for several years after councils cut free pest-buster services. They said that, while there were usual local reasons for particular pests being common, the overall trend across the UK was an increase in numbers. For example, while rats and cockroaches are particularly common in large cities such as London, areas such as Fife, in Scotland, are much more prone to ants. Scotland as a whole has seen an explosion in the ant population in the last four years, will call-outs to treat the problem increasing three-fold. A graph compiled by the British Pest Control Association shows Wales is the most rat-infested country in the UK (left) and another shows the prevalence of mice by country (right_ While inner-city areas such as Birmingham and London were plagued by rats and cockroaches, more rural areas such as\u00a0North Lanarkshire were overrun by wasps (pictured) Meanwhile, residents of North Lanarkshire in Scotland were the most likely to report problems with wasps. After an especially wet summer in 2012-13 which killed off a lot of the UK's wasps, 2013-14 saw a boom in the number of the pests, especially in Scotland. The survey also revealed that the number of local authorities who provide a free pest control service has declined by 26 per cent over the past four years. And the BCPA is warning that this the potential to prompt a significant increase in pests, including rats and bedbugs. Simon Forrester, chief executive of the BCPA, said: 'Our study provides a comprehensive and graphic indication of the demand placed on local authorities for pest control. 'There are many localised reasons why a particular area could have a high prevalence of a certain pest, but there's certainly a recurring theme. 'If an infestation of any pest isn't dealt with quickly and professionally, it's likely to spread. 'The problem then becomes much more expensive and carries a greater risk to public health.'

Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders was forced into a humiliating climbdown after a jury threw out yet another Old Bailey case. She abandoned the trials of nine reporters accused of illegally paying public officials for information, finally admitting there was little appetite among the public for journalists who expose matters of public interest to be jailed. Former Mirror reporter Graham Brough talks to media as he leaves the Old Bailey court in London after he and three other tabloid journalists were cleared of paying public officials for stories Her decision sparked an ugly blame game as the architects of the \u00a320million \u2018politically-motivated witch hunt\u2019 turned against each other. Prosecutors and police pointed the finger at the Leveson inquiry and MPs for whipping up a storm of hysteria over the work of the Press. And Scotland Yard highlighted how their inquiries were possible only thanks to millions of confidential emails released by News International. The man in charge at the start of the tainted Met Police probe into tabloid journalists \u2013 Operation Elveden \u2013 was former DPP and now Labour parliamentary candidate Keir Starmer. Last night campaigners questioned why the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was still putting three journalists in the dock for the same supposed offences. One senior figure said \u2018enough is enough\u2019, adding: \u2018It was always wrong for journalists to have been prosecuted for doing their jobs.\u2019 The landmark U-turn came yesterday after a jury threw out the case against three Sun journalists and one former Daily Mirror reporter. Lucy Panton, former News of the World crime reporter, had her conviction quashed by the Court of Appeal after being the first to be found guilty Brandon Malinsky, Neil Millard and Tom Wells, as well as their Fleet Street rival Graham Brough, were cleared of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. They were accused of funnelling cash to public officials in exchange for leaks from inside some of Britain\u2019s most secure jails. But the jury found that exposing how taxpayers\u2019 cash was wasted on bingo games for illegal immigrants and lavished on child killer Jon Venables was not a crime. Within hours, the CPS threw in the towel on nine other cases, including fresh prosecutions and retrials. The decision followed a review sparked by the Court of Appeal quashing the conviction of the first journalist to be convicted. It can now be revealed for the first time that ex-News of the World crime editor Lucy Panton was found guilty of bribing officials only for her conviction to be overturned. Some of the most senior judges in the country criticised how the archaic law of misconduct in public office \u2013 under which prosecutions were brought \u2013 had been applied, fatally undermining other cases. The CPS move leaves Operation Elveden in tatters. Of the 27 journalists charged, 23 have been cleared, had their cases dropped or seen their convictions quashed or founder at the Court of Appeal. In addition, 14 journalists were investigated, including many left on bail for many months, but not prosecuted. Three Sun journalists \u2013 news editor Chris Pharo, crime reporter Anthony France and reporter Jamie Pyatt \u2013 still face trial. A decision must be made within a week over whether Tom Wells should be retried on one charge on which the jury could not reach a verdict. By contrast, 21 of the 28 public officials \u2013 including police, prison officers and Ministry of Defence staff \u2013 charged under the inquiry have been convicted. Prosecutors faced a furious attack in the wake of yesterday\u2019s decision. Media commentator Roy Greenslade said it was \u2018remarkable\u2019 that prosecutors were still pursuing three Sun journalists, adding: \u2018Enough is enough.\u2019 The Sun newspaper reporter Tom Wells (left) leaves the Old Bailey court with colleague Neil Millard (right) The Sun's night news editor Brandon Malinsky (left) had his case dropped today. The jury could not decide on one count against former Serco immigration detention centre official Mark Blake (right) Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Mr Malinsky said he had endured \u2018two years of torture\u2019. He added: \u2018I think the police and CPS have been a disgrace bringing my case and other cases to court. It\u2019s a disgraceful waste of public money.\u2019 The nine journalists whose forthcoming cases have been dropped include ex-Mirror reporter Greig Box-Turnbull and Stephen Moyes of the News of the World. Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson and royal editor Clive Goodman will not face retrials because prosecutors said it was no longer in the public interest. Sun reporter Vince Soodin, former deputy news editor Ben O\u2019Driscoll and former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman will also not be prosecuted. The final two reporters to be told they face no further action are Panton and Ryan Sabey, who has been convicted but has leave to appeal, something the CPS said it will not contest. Mrs Saunders said the original police inquiry was \u2018inevitable\u2019 and left prosecutors with a \u2018duty\u2019 to act.

Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately.

He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit \u2013 but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills. 'There is also a preference for higher targeted public spending even if that means the deficit is not eliminated in the next five years and targeted tax increases for those with the greatest income and wealth.'", "reference": "another independence vote ranks 19th on list of 23 policies for scots . comes after nicola sturgeon refused to rule out staging a second vote . snp leader has also attacked the tory pledge to hold an eu referendum . but ipsos mori poll reveals scots prefer a say on brussels to independence .", "sentences": ["scottish first minister nicola sturgeon was campaigning in aberdeen .", "scottish first minister nicola sturgeon refused to rule out a second vote .", "scottish first minister nicola sturgeon refused to rule out a second vote ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"scottish first minister nicola sturgeon was campaigning in aberdeen .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"scottish first minister nicola sturgeon refused to rule out a second vote .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"scottish first minister nicola sturgeon refused to rule out a second vote .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["coreference error", "no error", "coreference error"]}

But honest people will not face any problem, he added.After Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.Thousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.There are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.The 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.People will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of black money - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.Government guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.New 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.A new 1,000 rupee note with a new dimension and design will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.They can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.", "reference": "the plan to withdraw high-value rupee notes in india had to be kept secret, prime minister narendra modi has said.", "sentences": ["the banks in the indian capital, delhi, have been shut down because of corruption and corruption, the bbc has learned."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["LinkE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"the banks in the indian capital, delhi, have been shut down because of corruption and corruption, the bbc has learned.\",\n        \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\",\n        \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

And which still, despite its dire current results, has two world champions in the cockpit - one of them, Fernando Alonso, arguably the best on the grid.Listen: Dennis on Alonso, loyalty & mentalityThe slump started in 2013, when McLaren lost its way on chassis design, but still had the best engine.Now, the team seem to have got their mojo back with the car but the problems lie with the Honda power-unit.This is a far cry from the previous era of one of the most famous partnerships in F1 - it is with Honda that McLaren achieved their greatest successes of an illustrious history.In 1988, they swept a season like no-one has since, even Mercedes. With the two best drivers in the world in their cars, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost, they won 15 of the 16 races.They dominated the next four years, before spending several years in the doldrums - a dip at times as bad as the latest one - before more resounding success, with Mika Hakkinen and Mercedes engines in 1998-99.Amazingly, the team's last constructors' title was in the first of those two years of victories with the 'flying Finn'.They should have won it again, in 2007, when Alonso and Lewis Hamilton were team-mates and finished agonisingly tied in the championship, a single point behind the winner, Kimi Raikkonen of Ferrari.But although the team scored more points than any other, McLaren were kicked out of the constructors' championship that year - and fined $100m - after being found guilty of benefitting from their illegal possession of reams of Ferrari technical information.There was another scandal two years later - this time dubbed 'lie-gate' - after Hamilton and  sporting director Dave Ryan were found to have misled the stewards at the Australian Grand Prix. This led to a humiliating public apology from Hamilton, and the sack for Ryan.Until 2012, when Hamilton and team-mate Jenson Button won seven races between them, the victories kept coming, but other than Hamilton's in 2008, the titles dried up - and now the wins have, too.In many ways, their current predicament is nothing surprising. McLaren's F1 history has, like those of many long-term participants, been a cycle of triumph and decline.Their first decade, following the team's establishment by the New Zealand F1 driver Bruce McLaren was spent building up the team into an increasingly powerful force, a process that continued despite the founder's death in a testing crash in 1970.Their maiden title came in 1974, with the Brazilian Emerson Fittipaldi. Another followed two years later, courtesy of James Hunt in his now-famous battle with Ferrari's Niki Lauda.But then the team began to slip backwards, left behind by the technology of the time. Rather like now.So alarming was the dip in form that main sponsor Marlboro engineered a coup, bringing on board Ron Dennis, first as co-team boss. He took complete control shortly afterwards and has held it ever since, in one role or another.Dennis built the team up to its first period of real domination in 1984-5, followed by the Honda era, then a partnership with Mercedes, before stepping back in 2009, only to take back control after the team's disastrous 2013 season.So far, his return has not had its intended effect. But is McLaren in a period of slow - some would even say terminal - decline? Or are the good times around the corner again?Dennis insists it is only a matter of time before success will return.It is McLaren, he told BBC Sport in an interview to mark the team's golden anniversary, who will break Mercedes' hegemony in F1, and become the next team after the German giants to win the title.This, after all, is why Alonso returned to the team in 2015 - a decision widely questioned at the time because of the difficult relationship he had with Dennis when they worked together in 2007.The Spanish two-time champion left Ferrari because he felt they would never get there; joined McLaren partly because there was nowhere else to go, but also because he felt the renewed Honda partnership was his best chance to win an elusive third title in the end.Dennis and his lieutenants believe they are in the process of arresting the slide, that the car is among the very best this year, and that next year Honda - who last year re-entered F1 too soon - will ensure their engine is, too.They can see the progress, they say, and it is only a matter of time before they again deliver championships, plural, as Dennis puts it.But right now, belief is all they have.

Davis used precise groundstrokes to keep Bouchard on her heels throughout the second set. Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead.

The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra \u00a3334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross McEwan said: \u2018This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.\u2019 The latest news wiped more than \u00a3700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power.

Mr Goodwin \u2013 nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting \u2013 was even knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. \u2018It\u2019s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.\u2019", "reference": "rbs has racked up # 50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers . state-back giant warned that it faces ` another tough year ' to come . lurched to a # 446million loss for the first three months of the year .", "sentences": ["rbs reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year .", "it includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment accounts in the uk .", "rbs was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the us ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "EntE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"rbs reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year .\", \"reason\": \"predicate error\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"it includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment accounts in the uk .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"rbs was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge , mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the us .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error", "entity error", "no error"]}

James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she\u2019d be born with EPP too.

Nancy Perry will no longer teach students at Dublin Middle School and will retire at the end of the year, city schools superintendent Chuck Ledbetter announced on Tuesday. Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments. Scott said he immediately requested a parent-teacher conference to which Perry brought along her husband Bill, who sits on the county Board of Education. Instead of discussing Nancy Perry's classroom comments, Scott says that she and her husband showed him what he described as internet propaganda. 'She showed it to me and said, See, Obama is a baby killer. He aborts babies at nine months old as they're coming through the birth canal.'

We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd. For Press freedom, the UK is ranked 27th.

Scroll down for video Drug: Trials show Avastin, which is used in several other cancers, gives women about four months\u2019 extra life Each year an estimated 600 women with advanced cervical cancer could benefit from Avastin, costing \u00a33,370 for a month\u2019s treatment. The drug\u2019s use was accelerated by the US Food and Drug Administration which approved Avastin plus chemotherapy for advanced cervical cancer in August 2014. Nearly 3,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in the UK each year, and it kills around 1,000 women. Cervical cancer, which is cancer of the neck of the womb, is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under. It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good. However, for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely. Reality TV star Jade Goody died in March 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease. The time between her diagnosis and death was just months, suggesting her cancer was already at an advanced stage on diagnosis and within five months it had spread. Cervical cancer:\u00a0Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27 after a very public battle with the disease Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab and widely used in patients with bowel cancer, is the first new treatment since the chemotherapy drug topotecan was approved in 2006. Dr Mary McCormack, Consultant Clinical Oncologist at University College Hospital, said \u2018Cervical cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in younger women. \u2018For those women with metastatic disease (that has spread) or whose cancer recurs after surgery/chemoradiation there are very few treatment options. It is very welcome indeed that when Avastin is added to chemotherapy it prolongs survival by approximately four months. \u2018For a young mother sitting in front of you with small children, or indeed any patient with cancer, that length of time can be extremely important.\u2019 Robert Music, chief executive of Jo\u2019s Cervical Cancer Trust, said \u2018This regulatory decision for Avastin is positive news. To date, prognosis for women who receive a late-stage diagnosis of cervical cancer has often been poor. \u2018Any additional time that can be provided through new drugs with limited impact on quality of life is extremely valuable to patients and their families.\u2019 Trial findings show Avastin combined with chemotherapy can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 26 per cent compared with chemotherapy alone. The drug, made by Switzerland-based drug makers Roche, led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13 months. Avastin works by blocking the blood supply to the tumour, starving it of oxygen and nutrients. An independent blood supply is critical for a tumour to grow beyond 2mm and spread to other parts of the body.11 Tumours develop their own blood supply in a process called angiogenesis by releasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) \u2013 a key driver for tumour growth.

His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory \u2013 or a loss \u2013 could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that.

Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece American Pie.  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie. There is no real way to categorize McLean's American Pie for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. The Big Bopper Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. The next day I went to school in shock and guess what? McLean recalled.  Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.  By cathartically writing American Pie, McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, Tapestry, in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the generation lost in space.   When his cultural anthem American Pie was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A Changin as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of American Pie as one would of Henry Longfellow's Evangeline or Johnny Mercer's Moon River -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of American Pie, for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel On the Road. Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when American Pie topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing American Pie at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing and they were singing everybody spontaneously joins in with the Bye, Bye chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes American Pie so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When American Pie suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like Danny Boy or Streets of Laredo or Shenandoah, it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, American Pie still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret American Pie, it's fair to surmise that the king is Elvis Presley, Helter Skelter refers to the Charles Manson murders, the jester on the sidelines in a cast is Bob Dylan, and Jack Flash the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to American Pie. Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose American Pie as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were Over the Rainbow (by Harold Arlen and E.Y Yip Harburg), White Christmas (by Irving Berlin), This Land is Your Land (by Woody Guthrie) and Respect (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, American Pie is one of the greatest songs ever written.

I was always the Wales goalkeeper.It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict.Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz, he said.Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches, he said.We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us, he said.Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.I was very lucky.

The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place. 'Crowding and congestion will have entirely negative effects, increasing pressure on schools, hospitals and particularly housing.'", "reference": "fastest growing groups will be from pakistan , bangladesh and africa . minority population will increase three times faster than whites to 2051 . between 2011 and 2051 total population will increase from 63.4 m to 77.4 m . campaigners warn this will put strain on housing , schools and the nhs .", "sentences": ["one in four britons will be from black or minority groups by 2051 .", "campaigners fear sudden increase will put pressure on housing , schools and the nhs .", "baby boom among ethnic minorities will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"one in four britons will be from black or minority groups by 2051 .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"campaigners fear sudden increase will put pressure on housing , schools and the nhs .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"baby boom among ethnic minorities will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century .\", \"reason\": \"predicate error\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "no error", "predicate error"]}

Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there\u2019s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (\u00a316), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America \u2013 including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

The country is due to repay a \u00a3330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list.

Jamie Silvonek was charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced Thursday. Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was fatally stabbed in the driveway of her Upper Macungie Township home early March 15, hours after taking Jamie Silvonek and the eighth-grader's boyfriend, Army Spc. Caleb Barnes, to a concert, according to court documents.

He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press. 'So there's a lot of things we have to decipher here.'

Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. Police found the victim's blood-soaked car submerged in a pond and traced it to the Silvonek family's home in\u00a0Upper Macungie Township (pictured) Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' The teenager then texted Barnes: 'She threatened to throw me out of the house. I want her gone,' the affidavit said. Later, she allegedly wrote to him: 'Just do it.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek.

I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role, he said.He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interviewBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah CampbellThe recent headlines about William being a work shy prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.He accepts that he will be criticised but it's not something I take completely to heart.An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was the best role model I could have in front of me.Full details of Queen's birthday celebrationsTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.Republic said the Queen's birthday does not warrant this kind of coverage and that the BBC had a duty to report, not to celebrate the royals.Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had failed completely to report the birthday in a way that was fair, balanced and proportionate.", "reference": "prince william has answered criticism of his commitment to royal duties, saying he is willing to take on more responsibility when the time comes.", "sentences": ["prince william has described the queen\\'s birthday as a ``special monarch\\'\\', as he marked her 90th birthday."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"prince william has described the queen's birthday as a ``special monarch'', as he marked her 90th birthday.\",\n        \"reason\": \"entity error\",\n        \"category\": \"entity error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

Perry is alleged to have told students that Obama is a Muslim and that any parent who support him couldn't be Christian, either. Nancy Perry, left, won't teach again at Dublin Middle School in Georgia after she gave students her highly critical personal opinion of President Barack Obama and parent Jimmie Scott complained A 12-year-old boy in Perry's class brought the matter to the attention of his father, Jimmie Scott, who complained to the school. 'If your parents voted for Obama, they're evil and I don't see how your parents could vote for someone that's Muslim' he told WMAZ, paraphrasing Perry's alleged comments.

If we bat two days the result will go our way. There's no reason why we can't dig deep.We've got to learn from our first innings with the bat - be more patient. There were too many 30s in the first innings, so we need to try and push on a bit more and have a couple of our top five get big hundreds.England batsman Ian Bell: There are no gimmes and we expect more tomorrow.

It is an ominous warning from a man who has won nine of the last 11 grands prix, been on pole at the last four, and who already holds a 27-point cushion in the drivers' standings. It is no wonder after winning in Bahrain, when Hamilton stepped out of his Mercedes, he immediately stood on top of it and pretended to smack an imaginary baseball out of the circuit. Lewis Hamilton stands on his Mercedes after winning the Bahrain\u00a0Grand Prix It was another 'home run' performance from Hamilton, a man who claims he is a perfectionist, and who appears to be driving as close to perfection as can possibly be achieved in the sport. It led to the suggestion that perhaps he was feeling unbeatable, to which he replied: 'I don't know what the feeling of being unbeatable is. 'I know I feel very powerful in this car with the package we have, and I feel I'm able to get everything from it. 'I also feel more comfortable in this car than I did in the one last year, and I feel within myself, with whatever approach I have, the power is greater than ever in terms of strength in the car. 'It's like 'yes'. I put the car there and it goes there, I get the exit. 'Naturally you always feel there are things you can still improve on, but it's hard to always pinpoint what those are and to tell the team what to focus on. Hamilton is congratulated by Ferrari rival Kimi Raikkonen on Sunday 'That's what a team leader has to do, and, along with Nico (Rosberg), I'm trying to guide the team, to tell them where to go next.' So just how close to perfection does Hamilton feel? 'There are always areas. I'll look and think 'Could I have braked later for the pit entry? Could I have done a better outlap?' said the 30-year-old. 'I feel I'm doing the best I can, and I'm learning and improving at the same time, which is all I can ask for.' Yet do not dare to suggest to Hamilton that he does not work as hard off the track in terms of poring over every aspect of what is required to ensure he is at one with his car. In being compared with former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button in the past, or Rosberg at present, the feeling has generally been they are more studious than Hamilton, who simply just drives. 'Of course I analyse. You can't be a world champion without doing that,' Hamilton said. 'I remember speaking about this a long time ago and I don't know if people get a perception as to who you are as a driver, but I work as hard as any other driver. 'Just because I do things differently it doesn't mean I'm worse. Race winner Hamilton celebrates with the trophy on the podium in Bahrain 'There was a point where people said Nico was a doctor of this or that; Jenson was a doctor of his tyres. 'I tick off all the boxes, and I've worked to do that. 'The results I get are not only from my raw ability because I study hard, I work hard to make notes about my tyres, about every single thing I do, which I've done since my days in Formula Three. 'Ultimately, I don't care what people think. I just do the job.' Hamilton certainly has Rosberg scratching his head as the German appears to have run out of ideas as to how to beat his main rival. Hamilton has now set a personal record run of 11 consecutive grands prix in the points - twice finishing second in addition to the nine wins. If you include the double points for the final race of last season, Hamilton has scored an astonishing 286 from a potential 300. It is not perfection, so perhaps there is a feeling of never being quite satisfied. 'That's natural for anyone who has the competitiveness I have,' said Hamilton. 'I know the potential I have, and whether or not I'm living up to it. 'I feel I am coming close to full potential - although who knows exactly what that is - but I do feel quite satisfied.' Which is why he also feels he still has more to give, starting with the next grand prix in three weeks' time in Spain. 'I got the pole, I did the job (in Bahrain),' Hamilton said.

Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs.

The PDP failed to get a national spread of votes, doing well only in the south-east and the oil-rich Niger Delta. Most states in the north went to the APC, along with Nigeria's commercial hub, Lagos, in the south-west.However, the APC failed to win in any of Nigeria's five oil-producing states. This will be of huge concern to President-elect Muhammadu Buhari, as militant groups could disrupt oil production and starve the federal government of much-needed oil revenue.  It is unlikely that the PDP governors in the five states would help Gen Buhari rein in the militants.In parts of the country, the elections were marred by violence due to stiff rivalry, and the battle for power and money. Ethnic differences also fuelled the conflict in some areas, but overall the elections have been more peaceful than in previous years, raising hopes that Nigeria's democracy is maturing.Why Jonathan lost?Buhari's historic victoryNigeria's 36 governors enjoy wide powers and are extremely influential. Some, especially in oil-producing areas, control bigger budgets than those of national governments in some neighbouring West African countries.The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) reported 66 violent incidents at polling stations - higher than in the presidential poll.Most of the violence took place in Rivers and other southern states, where voting at some polling stations had to be extended.On Sunday, Inec also announced that the APC had retained power in Lagos state.It means that when Gen Buhari takes over the presidency it will be the first time that the party of the president has controlled Lagos - the commercial capital - since the advent of multi-party democracy in 1999.Our correspondent says the PDP will have to go through a period of introspection, and then rebuild itself under a new leader.The party was in power for 16 years, and voters felt that it was time for change, he says.It had been hit by the defection of governors and MPs to the APC ahead of the elections.The PDP also faced widespread allegations of corruption during its rule, and was accused of failing to do enough to end an Islamist-led insurgency in the north-east where it suffered huge defeats.", "reference": "the party of nigeria\\'s incoming president has won a landslide in elections for powerful state governors, ending the former ruling party\\'s dominance.", "sentences": ["nigeria\\'s main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria\\'s presidential election."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"nigeria's main opposition party, the main opposition party (biggest), has won elections in nigeria's presidential election.\",\n        \"reason\": \"predicate error\",\n        \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks The TSA called the incident deplorable. These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable, the agency said in a written statement to CNN. All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency.

Hiroshi Ueda, a photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta, claims that he first invented the selfie stick in the 1980s. He said he came up with the idea after struggling to get pictures of himself and his wife together while they were in Europe. Scroll down for video Hiroshi Ueda, holding his extender stick for taking 'selfies' which he patented in 1983 while working for Minolta After having his camera stolen by a child he asked to take their picture in the Louvre Museum in Paris, he dreamed up a solution - an extendable stick with a tripod screw at the end. The 'extender stick', as he called it, was designed for use with new compact cameras that were being developed at the time. Whether taking in a spectacular panorama, visiting a famous landmark or watching a concert; the chances are your view has been ruined by  a selfie stick on at least one occasion. Now the situation may be about to get a whole lot worse, because there\u2019s a next-generation stick that can grasp a tablet as well as a mobile phone. The contraption lets selfie addicts take photos  of themselves using their iPad, ensuring they can capture the best possible duck pout or cheesy grin in their shots. The supersized stick is available on the website Accessory Geeks for just $23 (\u00a316), suggesting that they could be coming to a street near you soon. He added a mirror to the front of the camera so that photographers could see exactly what they were doing. Despite being patented in 1983, the extender stick failed to become a success - mainly due to the poor image quality it captured. But that did not stop Mr Ueda from compiling a family album of family 'selfies' using his device. Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'The idea of taking a picture of yourself was very new back then. 'The philosophy behind it was that I didn't need to rely on anyone else to take a photo - I could take a picture of myself whenever and wherever I liked.' Some 30 years later selfie sticks are now hugely popular - used by narcissists and celebrities everywhere to capture images of themselves in their surroundings. They have become such a menace that many tourist venues, museums, concert venues and stadiums have banned them. Perhaps ironically, Apple - the company that could be blamed for kickstarting the selfie phenomenon by putting a camera on the front of its phones in the first place - has also banned them from its next conference. Mr Ueda used his 'extender stick' to take pictures of himself with his family while on holiday in Europe (above) Modern versions of the extender stick allow a smartphone to be held aloft and use a remote trigger to take the photograph or video. Mr Ueda's patent ran out in 2003, however, so he has not benefited from the recent boom. Instead Canadian inventor Wayne Fromm developed a hand-held extendable selfie stick in the early 2000s, which he called the Quik Pod. While his product has sold well, there are many others available. Mr Ueda said: 'My idea came too early, but that's just one of those things. 'I patented about 300 ideas, so that was just one of them. We call it a 3am invention - it arrived too early.' The idea of selfies, however, is not new. Remote timers and triggers have been available on cameras for decades. A recently unearthed photograph also showed that some early photographers adopted unusual methods to take their own photo - such as using a broom handle to hit the trigger on their camera. Michael Pritchard, Director-General of The Royal Photographic Society, said there is evidence of selfies going back as far as the 1840s. Selfie sticks divide opinion - some people love them and others hate them. But a growing number of venues and attractions have deemed them such a nuisance that they are banning their use. Last month the National Gallery in London became the latest major museum to instruct visitors that the devices were not welcome. It follows bans in galleries in France and America \u2013 including the Palace of Versailles and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Organisers of two major US festivals have also made clear what they think of selfie sticks. The Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza are the latest in a string of concert venues and historic landmarks to ban the use of the controversial tech gadgets on their grounds. According to NME , London's O2 Arena and Wembley Arena have also prohibited them, while Rome's Colosseum also do not permit the use of the gadgets.

Blended into the background, these models are difficult to tell apart from their surroundings. Camouflaged in body paint, women pose for the camera against a backdrop of overgrown woodland. A series of pictures by German artist J\u00f6rg D\u00fcsterwald show body-painted models camouflaged in woodland In many of the pictures, the intricate detailing of the paint on the naked bodies means it is virtually impossible to determine where the person is.

Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014.\u00a0He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call\u00a0it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to\u00a0three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily\u00a0in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County\u00a0Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor.

One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors.One employee wrote on Facebook: Attackers are inside the hospital. Pray for us.The hospital attack marks a change in approach by so-called Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan - it's the first time they have engaged directly with security forces in the capital.Previously they have targeted civilian gatherings, mainly of Shia Muslims, as well as causing carnage at the Supreme Court last month.But at the hospital they used an approach more commonly associated with the Taliban - blowing the gates open to allow gunmen to enter. This suggests they now have the resources and the military training to expand their attacks.If that's the case, the security forces could face more such assaults in the coming months.In the two years since it announced its presence in Afghanistan, IS has mainly engaged with Afghan forces - and more powerful, rival Taliban fighters - in the east, near the Pakistan border. It has failed so far to widen its base in the country - one reason, observers suggest, it may now be mounting more headline-grabbing attacks.The government claims it has rooted out IS militants from a number of bases in the east - but has yet to dislodge them from mountainous areas they control.TV pictures showed people hiding from the gunmen on ledges outside windows on upper floors of the building.More than six hours after the attack began, interior ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi tweeted that special forces had ended their operation and all the attackers were dead.The IS-affiliated Amaq news agency shared two images via the Telegram messaging app that appeared to show one of the militants taking part in the assault and a number of dead bodies.Afghanistan's de-facto deputy leader Abdullah Abdullah also condemned the attack on Twitter and vowed to avenge the blood of our people.IS announced it was moving into Afghanistan and Pakistan when it declared its so-called Khorasan Province in 2015 and has since carried out a number of attacks.In July 2016, a suicide bomb attack on a rally in Kabul killed about 80 people.Three months later, two similar attacks during the religious festival of Ashura claimed about 30 lives and in November 2016 an attack at a mosque in Kabul killed more than 30.IS also claimed a suicide attack at Kabul's Supreme Court last month that killed 22 people and has stepped up activity in both Afghanistan and Pakistan.The Taliban has also been carrying out attacks, killing 16 people in Kabul in suicide attacks a week ago, after beginning its Spring offensive early.", "reference": "more than 30 people have been killed after attackers dressed as doctors stormed the largest military hospital in kabul, afghan officials say.", "sentences": ["taliban militants have attacked a hospital in the afghan capital kabul, killing at least 14 people, officials say."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"taliban militants have attacked a hospital in the afghan capital kabul, killing at least 14 people, officials say.\",\n        \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\",\n        \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.Italy is prone to earthquakes. In 2009 almost 300 people died in a quake in L'Aquila in the central Abruzzo region.Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology (INGV) said the quake struck at 15:48 (14:48 GMT), with its epicentre in Garfagnana.Several aftershocks of lower magnitude were felt across a large area.Phone lines were down and power supplies were cut in the Garfagnana area, Italian news agency Ansa reports.

The driver, known as Salim, is alleged to have assaulted the tourist in Jaipur on Friday evening. The man, from Todabhim in Karauli district of Rajasthan, is accused of assaulting the 20-year-old woman and is being held in custody. A spokesman for Rajasthan Police said they had taken statements from the woman and her friend, India Times reported. 'We have arrested taxi driver Salim on a complaint filed by a British tourist on early Saturday.' said the man. 'He was arrested under Section 354 of IPC (Indian Penal Code). He was sent to judicial custody,' His arrest follows a number of incidents reported to have taken place in India against tourists and locals, which have led to widespread protests. On February 8 a Japanese tourist filed a complaint accusing a tout of raping her in Dudu, around 60km away from Jaipur. The woman had been on a tour when the man allegedly approached her and offered his service as a guide. In March a 75-year-old Indian nun was gang raped by a group of eight robbers when she confronted them after they broke in to the\u00a0Convent of Jesus and Mary School in West Bengal state's Nadia district. There is a heightened sensitivity to the issue of sexual assault in India at the moment after officials last month banned India's Daughter, a documentary about the gang rape and murder of an Indian student in Delhi. Officials said the documentary would cause further disorder if it was shown, following a number of protests and incidents of vigilante justice in the country. The documentary explained the brutal rape and murder of 23-year-old student Jyoti Singh, who was attacked on a bus when she returned home from the cinema. Recent attacks in India have resulted in street protests with many calling for more protection for women One of the six men convicted of the attack, bus driver Mukesh Singh, was interviewed in prison and told researchers that had Jyoti not fought back she would not have been killed. Her death led to protests throughout India and outraged the world. Jyoti Singh Pandey, a physiotherapy student, was gang raped as she travelled on a bus. The 23-year-old suffered in hospital for 13 days from her injuries before she died. Vinay Sharma, 20, Akshay Thakur, 28, Pawan Gupta, 19, and Mukesh Singh, 26, were all sentenced to death for her rape. Ram Singh, co-accused and widely considered the leader of the group, was found dead in his cell. A minor also found guilty was sentenced to three years in a reformatory institution. Her death sparked angry protests in India and internationally about misogyny in the country. The attention forced judges to prioritise the case and the lawyer's association in Saket reportedly refused to defend the perpetrators. Last month an angry mob were seen on video footage beating a man to death in the street who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl. Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd in Nagaland in eastern India. Ibo Cha was said to have been beaten for an hour before he died of his injuries. The footage was shot in September last year after the girl's body was found in woodland, enraging locals. But it only came to light after earlier this year alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan was kidnapped from prison and dragged through the streets of the same area. He was then stripped naked and beaten to death. He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times.

Aliesha Peterson, 22, detailed the extensive fitness routine that helped her go from 145lbs to 127lbs \u2013 and enabled the Alberta, Canada, resident to gain a noticeably fitter, and much more muscular, physique, as well as an impressive six-pack. 'I can honestly say I am sooo thankful I started taking better care of myself [sic],' she wrote under her Reddit name ahhhgodzilla.

Scroll down for video Impressive results: Aliesha Peterson, 22, first started exercising in August 2013, left; as of April 2015, right, she has lost nearly 20lbs and gained a six-pack Aliesha wasn't always a fan of working out - and explained that she didn't start hitting the gym to look better in a bikini, either. 'I was extremely depressed and refusing to go back on anti-depressants,' she explained. 'I went and saw a therapist, and she recommended that I join a gym and start working out three times a week. 'I reluctantly obliged and to be completely honest, I absolutely hated it. 'I hated how uncomfortable I felt there, that I obviously had no idea what I was doing.' But after three months of sticking with it, she admitted that she started to 'somewhat enjoy it'. Aliesha's routine is made up of exercises that focus on a different part of her body for each day of the week, and she will often do cardio on the weekends. Her workouts include several sets of squats, bench presses, crunches, curls, and planks. On Wednesdays, she works on her back, which she said is her favorite part of her body. Her back exercises include deadlifts, hyperextensions, and chin ups. Bringing sexy back: The 22-year-old says her back is her favorite part of her body, and she focuses on exercises to strengthen it every Wednesday 'Before' body: Aliesha, pictured here in 2013 before she started exercising, was by no means overweight, but she has since become more toned by sticking to a demanding workout schedule After about six months, Aliesha started changing her eating habits, too. While she once stuck to an unhealthy diet which included fast food 'at least twice a day', she began cooking her own meals and choosing to eat healthy food. Now, her diet consists of eggs, yogurt, fruit, chicken, seeds and nuts, green smoothies made with vegetables, protein shakes, turkey, and salmon. Aliesha admits that her story isn't one of shocking rapid weight loss - but she says her slow progress is the reason she's been so successful. 'I'm sure if I completely changed my lifestyle all at once that my results would have been a lot more impressive in a much shorter amount of time, but it would not have been sustainable,' she wrote. Because she's worked at a slow, steady pace, she's been able to maintain her new figure - which has been a boon to her self-esteem. 'I am much more confident in my body,' she told Daily Mail Online. 'I no longer hate looking in the mirror and have learned to accept my flaws and am able to see the positive qualities I possess as well.'

'I truly believe the key to bettering yourself is to cultivate and preserve healthy habits,' she continued. 'The first few months are the hardest, but once you make it through that stage it becomes a lot less painful, and you may even learn to enjoy it like I have.' She is also enjoying what working out has done for her mental health. 'While I still struggle with depression, it is much, much less severe,' she said. 'Instead of laying in bed all day crying, letting it consume me, I get up and do things - go to the gym, do yoga, walk my dogs, see friends. 'The best part of getting into this routine has definitely been the mental change,' she concluded.

But honest people will not face any problem, he added.After Mr Modi's surprise announcement on Tuesday night, the banks were closed on Wednesday.Thousands of panicked Indians have been flocking to banks since they reopened on Thursday.There are limits on cash withdrawals from ATMs and banks.The 500 ($7; \u00c2\u00a36) and 1,000 ($15; \u00c2\u00a312) rupee notes are the highest denomination notes in the country and are extremely common in India. Airports, railway stations, hospitals and fuel stations will only accept them until the end of today.People will be able to exchange their money at banks between 10 November and 30 December.The actual figure is unclear but correspondents say the issue of black money - which may have been acquired corruptly, or is being withheld from the tax authorities - is a huge problem. India's government hopes to flush out tax evaders and make money that is unaccounted for visible for tax purposes. There have been reports of tax raids in many parts of India.An individual can put as much as he or she likes into the bank - but withdrawals are limited so the banking system may end up being flooded with cash.Government guidelines say it is possible to exchange up to 4,000 rupees per day up to 24 November - anything over this will be subject to tax laws. People can also withdraw up to 10,000 rupees from a bank per day and a maximum of 20,000 rupees per week.New 2,000 and 500 rupee denomination notes with new security features are being given to people to replace those removed from circulation.A new 1,000 rupee note with a new dimension and design will also be introduced in due course, a senior government official said on Thursday.They can purchase foreign exchange equivalent to 5,000 rupees using these bank notes at airport exchange counters until midnight on Friday.", "reference": "the plan to withdraw high-value rupee notes in india had to be kept secret, prime minister narendra modi has said.", "sentences": ["india\\'s prime minister narendra modi has said he will no longer be able to withdraw money from banks, despite corruption and corruption."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CorefE", "LinkE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he will no longer be able to withdraw money from banks, despite corruption and corruption.\",\n        \"reason\": \"entity error\",\n        \"category\": \"entity error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

More than 10,000 have not survived. But for those who have survived, life will never be the same. And even for those who did not experience Ebola personally, the most severe public health emergency seen in modern times showed the world its vulnerability to disease. It revealed real flaws in government systems that are supposed to protect us. While the intensity of the largest Ebola epidemic in history has died down, and the initial dire predictions that there would be over a million infections by January never came true, dozens are still newly infected each week. The latest World Health Organization Report confirmed a total of 30 new confirmed cases of Ebola were reported in the week of April 5. This is the lowest weekly total since May 2014. But reports are mixed on stopping the virus completely: In Liberia and Sierra Leone, the number of cases has fallen so much, there are more treatment facilities than demand. WHO in Liberia is in the process of decommissioning surplus facilities. But in Guinea, of the 19 confirmed deaths from April 5, seven were only identified as Ebola post-mortem and there were reports of 21 unsafe burials. Taken together these data indicate that though surveillance is improving, unknown chains of transmission could be a source of new infections in the coming weeks, the latest WHO report said.

I take my responsibilities very seriously. But it's about finding your own way at the right time and if you're not careful duty can sort of weigh you down an awful lot at a very early age and I think you've got to develop into the duty role, he said.He said both his father and grandmother fully supported the fact that he was not yet fully engaged with royal duties, but when the time came to accept more responsibility he would do so.'I don't lie awake waiting to be king'- full Prince William interviewBBC deputy royal correspondent Sarah CampbellThe recent headlines about William being a work shy prince signalled a change in the relationship between the prince and a press pack who, up until now, have rarely criticised him.In the BBC's interview, it was interesting to see his response.He accepts that he will be criticised but it's not something I take completely to heart.An indication that negative headlines are likely to be par for the course in his role as a future heir but won't necessarily influence his decisions.It was clear that his priority remains trying to live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible, both for the sake of his wife and children but also himself.There was also a rare insight into what kind of monarch he plans to be.When asked about the different approach to public life taken by his father as opposed to the Queen his response was that the latter was the best role model I could have in front of me.Full details of Queen's birthday celebrationsTen stamps have been released to celebrate the Queen's birthday, including a stamp sheet featuring four generations of the Royal Family.The picture of the Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George was taken at Buckingham Palace last year.Six further stamps have been released for the head of state's 90th birthday, three focusing on the Queen's family life and three honouring her official role.On her actual birthday, on Thursday, the Queen and Prince Philip will walk around Windsor and unveil a plaque marking The Queen's Walkway, a 6.3km self-guided walking trail connecting 63 points of significance.It was designed to recognise the moment the monarch broke the record on 9 September 2015 held by her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria by being on the throne for 63 years and seven months.In the evening, she will light a beacon setting in train a series of more than 900 beacons across the UK and around the world to mark the milestone birthday.On Friday, US President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama will join the Queen for lunch at Windsor Castle.Britain's longest-serving monarch celebrates two birthdays each year, her actual birthday on 21 April and her official birthday on a Saturday in June.Republic said the Queen's birthday does not warrant this kind of coverage and that the BBC had a duty to report, not to celebrate the royals.Graham Smith, the republican pressure group's CEO, added that the BBC had failed completely to report the birthday in a way that was fair, balanced and proportionate.", "reference": "prince william has answered criticism of his commitment to royal duties, saying he is willing to take on more responsibility when the time comes.", "sentences": ["prince william has said she is ``incredibly important\\'\\'to be the queen\\'s 90th birthday, as he celebrates her 90th birthday."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CorefE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE", "GramE", "CorefE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"prince william has said she is ``incredibly important\\'\\'to be the queen\\'s 90th birthday, as he celebrates her 90th birthday.\",\n        \"reason\": \"coreference error\",\n        \"category\": \"coreference error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["coreference error"]}

Pat, 69, pictured left in her police woman fancy dress outfit, enjoys pole dancing with friend Julia, 67, right 'I really enjoy myself, I party hard,' she admitted on the Channel 5 show OAPs Behaving Badly. 'I have heard of the saying grow old gracefully but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said:\u00a0'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with\u00a0stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think my nanna shouldn't do that, it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away.

Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son.

Jamie Silvonek was charged as an adult with homicide and criminal conspiracy, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced Thursday. Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was fatally stabbed in the driveway of her Upper Macungie Township home early March 15, hours after taking Jamie Silvonek and the eighth-grader's boyfriend, Army Spc. Caleb Barnes, to a concert, according to court documents. Scroll down for video Star-crossed lovers: Jamie Silvonek (left), 14, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Army Spc Caleb Barnes (right), have been charged with killing the girl's mother for trying to break them up Barnes, who was on leave from Fort Meade in Maryland at the time of the slaying, was previously charged with homicide. He confessed to stabbing Cheryl Silvonek in the neck multiple times while they were in Silvonek's car, and Jamie Silvonek admitted she was there when he did it and helped dispose of the body, according to an affidavit of probable cause. Slain in cold blood: Cheryl Silvonek, 54, was stabbed several times in the neck inside her car after driving her daughter and Barnes from a concert The teen's attorney, John Waldron, said Thursday he believes his client was under Barnes' control, given the age disparity. 'There has to be some type of duress or coercion,' he said. Waldron said he intends to have Jamie Silvonek examined by a forensic psychologist and will petition to have the case moved to juvenile court. 'She cried incessantly and told me how much she missed her mom, and told me she was coerced, she was afraid she was going to be killed, she was afraid her dad was going to be killed,' Waldron told The Associated Press. 'So there's a lot of things we have to decipher here.' Authorities said Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October \u2014 when she was 13 \u2014 but that she told him she was 17.\u00a0He joined the military in February of 2012. Barnes graduated advanced training from the Presidio of Monterey, California, and his awards include the Good Conduct Medal and National Defense Service Medal, Army Times reported. Cheryl Silvonek found out about their relationship in early March and ordered the couple to break up, according to court documents. A day later, the teenager told Barnes she wanted her parents dead, the documents said. On March 14, Cheryl Silvonek learned that Barnes intended to take her daughter to a concert in Scranton. 'He is not coming to this house,' Cheryl Silvonek texted to her daughter, who had taken the SAT college entrance exam that morning, according to a police affidavit. Police found the victim's blood-soaked car submerged in a pond and traced it to the Silvonek family's home in\u00a0Upper Macungie Township (pictured) Silvonek's attorney said the girl tearfully told him she missed her mother, and claimed she was coerced by her soldier boyfriend and afraid for her life The eighth-grader sent her mother a text in response begging her to let them go. 'Mom, if I can't go I'm going to have a mental breakdown,' she said, according to the affidavit. 'I need to go and I need to be with my friends. I feel so desolate mother.' The teenager then texted Barnes: 'She threatened to throw me out of the house. I want her gone,' the affidavit said. Later, she allegedly wrote to him: 'Just do it.' Records show the 14-year-old was upset that her mother had shown her boyfriend her passport as proof that Silvonek was not 17. 'I can't stand her lying to you like this,' Jamie wrote to Barnes. 'SHE IS LYING ABOUT MY AGE,' reported Lehigh Valley Live. Cheryl Silvonek agreed to drive her daughter and Barnes to the show. On their way, the teenager and her boyfriend continued exchanging messages. 'I love you. We can do this. We'll just drive her car then, right?' Jamie wrote, the affidavit said. Barnes replied in a text, 'No. That leaves us as the suspects.' The three drove back to the Silvonek home after the show, and Barnes allegedly stabbed Cheryl Silvonek. The couple then ate at a restaurant and went to Walmart to buy gloves, bleach and other cleaning supplies, authorities said. Lies: Barnes and Jamie Silvonek met in October \u2014 when she was 13 \u2014 but that she told him she was 17 Police found the body in a shallow grave a few miles from the Silvonek home. The victim's blood-soaked car was found submerged in a pond nearby. Investigators were able to trace the car back to the Silvonek home.

encouraged to seek help if they are in distress and helped to identify sources of support.The workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing.The Healthy Me initiative was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, County Armagh, on Friday morning.The school's pastoral care co-ordinator, Helen Hamilton, is also its P7 teacher and said the programme has helped pupils and parents ahead of the big move.I see the anxiety in kids starting to build about secondary school, Ms Hamilton told BBC News NI.No fault of the secondary school - they're excellent and many are very excited to be going there - but they're apprehensive too and a lot of the time, that can be fed down from parents as well, they're worried about them.You're going from a very close-knit family atmosphere in a primary school - where you have one teacher who sees a child every day all day, and gets to know them and their wee quirks and can spot very quickly if they're out of sorts - to the very difficult job of senior school teachers who see them maybe for half an hour.It's more difficult for them to pick up on those things, much as they try, so parents sometimes need the reassurance and understanding that the transition can be easier than they expect.Getting a place in a secondary school can be source of stress however, and last month, thousands of P7 pupils began to sit this year's unofficial transfer tests, set by two different examination bodies, the Association of Quality Education (AQE) and GL Assessment.Pupils have the choice to sit either test, both tests, or none, but figures provided to the BBC by the two organisations indicated a slight rise in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year, with a total of 14,681, a rise from 14,575 in 2015.Transition from primary to secondary school is a particularly stressful time for children and we believe that targeting the programme at P6/P7 children will help them cope with this transition, Mr Babington said.Modern life is stressful and can impact on mental health, so implementing strategies for protecting children from stress and helping them learn to cope with change is an extremely positive influence on their young lives, the Action Mental Health boss added.Ms Hamilton said that in the workshops, children were taught breathing exercises, and how to relax, including how to take time out from busy after-school activity regimes.We, as a school, value so much the amount of evidence that shows that children who, mentally and emotionally, aren't ready to learn cannot progress, so   it's so important for us that children's social and emotional needs are met, the P7 teacher added.The need to strengthen the resilience of young people is one of the key challenges facing Northern Ireland's education system, according to the chief inspector of schools, Noelle Buick.All young people need to build resilience, she wrote in her  latest report, published last month..The chief inspector said pupils were facing complex challenges because the social context of relationships, values, attitudes and behaviours in which children and young people live and learn has changed significantly in recent years.It is timely to review the need for strengthening the resilience of children and young people at all levels through stronger and more explicit preventative education within the wider taught pastoral care curriculum.", "reference": "pupils preparing to leave primary school are being taught how to deal with stress and to be more resilient as part of a new mental health initiative.", "sentences": ["pupils in northern ireland are being encouraged to experience emotional wellbeing in transfer tests."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"pupils in northern ireland are being encouraged to experience emotional wellbeing in transfer tests.\",\n        \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\",\n        \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Rhodri Giggs, 37, revealed that he is now unemployed as he lost his licence after being found guilty of driving a Mercedes C200 without insurance. Under the 'totting-up' procedure, the former player-manager of non-league side Salford City, was forced to hand over his licence having already accrued six points from two previous speeding offences. Arriving for sentencing at Manchester Magistrates Court yesterday dressed in a black blazer and jeans, Giggs, of Salford said the offence on October 14 last year 'wasn't intentional'. But Eddie Coyle, prosecuting, said: 'On October 14 last year at around 9.30pm, he was driving a Mercedes along Hyde Road in Ardwick when he was brought to a stop by officers who performed checks and confirmed no insurance was in force.' After accepting his wrongdoing, Giggs was asked whether he would like to pursue an 'exceptional hardship' application in an attempt to retain his licence. He declined but added that he would permanently lose his job as an HGV driver with an agency and hadn't worked since December as he was waiting for the decision of the courts. Speaking for himself with no legal representation, he said: 'I work for an agency. If I lost my job I could get something else. 'I want to get this sorted today. I haven't worked since December and have no income or benefits.' Giggs was then banned from driving for six months, fined \u00a3110 and ordered to pay a \u00a320 victim surcharge and \u00a385 costs. In January, Rhodri Giggs spoke for the first time about his brother Ryan's eight-year affair with his then wife Natasha In January, Giggs spoke for the first time about his 41-year-old brother Ryan's eight-year affair with his then-wife Natasha which emerged in 2011. The Manchester United assistant manager allegedly told Rhodri that the affair was only ever 'about sex' Natasha Giggs later filed for divorce and went on to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, while Ryan's wife Stacey stood by his side. Giggs enjoyed a successful non-league football career playing for FC United of Manchester and is a former manager of Salford City.

But having a budget shop nearby means your house could sell for less In a study published today, Lloyds Bank investigated average house prices in postal districts that have chain supermarkets nearby, to see how they compared to the wider postal region. Houses in areas with a Waitrose cost an average of \u00a3354,378 \u2013 which was \u00a338,831 (12 per cent) more than typical prices for their regions. Sainsbury\u2019s also delivered a big boost to residents, as properties near the store were worth 10 per cent more (\u00a324,506) than ones in the surrounding area that weren\u2019t near a branch.

Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "reference": "richie benaud died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . his commentary style is considered synonymous with cricket . sportsmail recalls 10 of his best moments in the commentary box . read : when richie benaud welcomed viewers , they were able to relax . click here for richie benaud tributes as cricket world mourns legend .", "sentences": ["richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer .", "benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's first test delivery for australia in the 1993 ashes .", "benaud 's cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour , an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's first test delivery for australia in the 1993 ashes .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"benaud 's cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour , an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "no error", "no error"]}

Abase Hussen \u2013 who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year \u2013 conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of \u2018nothing\u2019 to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 Abase Hussen, circled, \u00a0marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies \u2013 with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. \u2018The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,\u2019 he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: \u2018We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.\u2019 Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: \u2018Not at all. Nothing.\u2019 Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u2018Remember that Amira Abase\u2019s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.\u2019 Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: \u2018I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.\u2019 Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: \u2018The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.\u2019 Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came \u2018for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English\u2019. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was \u2018just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists\u2019. Mr Hussen said he felt \u2018terrible\u2019 to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby\u2019s killers and said: \u2018It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 Amira fled to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16. A fourth girl from their school, Sharmeena Begum, left for Syria in December. Giving evidence to the MPs\u2019 committee, Mr Hussen accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents. Last night Tory MP Michael Ellis, who sits on the committee, said: \u2018I would certainly be in favour of Mr Hussen being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us. \u2018It\u2019s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13-year-old to such a rally. But then to tell a House of Commons committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to Syria, when you have taken her to more than one of these events, is simply breathtaking.\u2019", "reference": "abase hussen said maybe his daughter was influenced by attending a rally . amira abase was one of three teenage girls who fled to syria in february . mr hussen attended one rally alongside one of lee rigby 's killers . he said he moved to britain in 1999 for freedom and democracy .", "sentences": ["abase hussen , who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join is earlier this year .", "conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group al-muhajiroun .", "mr hussen told mps last month , after his daughter amira abase fled to syria aged 15 .", "it then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"abase hussen , who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join is earlier this year .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group al-muhajiroun .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"mr hussen told mps last month , after his daughter amira abase fled to syria aged 15 .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"it then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob .\", \"reason\": \"circumstantial error\", \"category\": \"circumstantial error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error", "no error", "out-of-context error", "circumstantial error"]}

Davis broke Bouchard's serve to love to take a 3-1 lead as the 21-year-old Canadian had a double fault, then sailed a forehand long to fall behind. Two games later, Davis hit a backhand to send back Bouchard's 102mph serve for a winner down the left sideline and a 5-1 lead.

He had performed most recently in Istanbul on Valentine's Day. The performer, who was also an accomplished guitarist, was first diagnosed with cancer in 1990, the year he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, and the year before he released the album that ignited his career. The cancer returned in 2005 and then again in 2014, Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu Agency reported. He died Friday in a hospital in Istanbul, five days after his 66th birthday. We are in grief over losing Kayahan, who contributed to Turkish music with countless compositions and marked a generation with his songs, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu tweeted. The singer, whose full name was Kayahan Acar, was born in Izmir province, in western Turkey on March 29, 1949. He grew up in Ankara, Turkey's capital, before moving to Istanbul. In 1990, he competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, finishing 17th. The following year he released an album titled I Made a Vow, which catapulted him to prominence. Though he recorded nearly 20 albums, that one would remain his most popular. His final album was released in 2007. Other artists recorded his material throughout his career. Videos available online show a vibrant performer with a thick shock of dark hair as he accompanies himself on guitar and croons in a clear tenor. Kayahan was best known for his love songs.

Among the highlights, as caught on tape and eventually uploaded to LiveLeak: I'm on television and you're in a f**king trailer, honey, and I wouldn't work at a scumbag place like this. Makes my skin crawl even being here. And, finally, Lose some weight, baby girl. It's pretty cringe-worthy stuff that seems difficult, if not impossible, to defend. McHenry quickly issued an apology, blaming the incident on a moment of intense frustration but admitting her mistake and accepting responsibility. It was, however, too late: the #firebrittmchenry hashtag was already trending on Twitter, where she was called everything from classist, class-less, and ugly on the inside to a sad, self-hating coward. ESPN, meanwhile, announced that McHenry would be suspended for a week. Certainly McHenry should have known better than to have used such words, even if that's what she was thinking, least of all because in our YouTube age, such missteps always come to light. But while McHenry's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement, evidence of a mean girl who never left high school, what's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on McHenry without fully knowing -- or, it seems, caring about -- the other side of the story. The video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only McHenry's responses, not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on. McHenry knew she was being taped; at one point, she looks directly at the camera. The employee even threatens to make the video public. Did McHenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak? Or because she truly could not help herself? Or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game? How Britt McHenry could have responded These days, there's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace, whether it's Lindsay Lohan or Brian Williams or Britt McHenry, who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing: that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial. The high price of public shaming online Sure, McHenry probably feels entitled, but that's our doing, too. We're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them, compensating them. And yet when, in a moment of frustration and stress, McHenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away, we're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve. You know what gives her the nerve? We do. (Be honest: When is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot?) But we're really no better than she is. The problem with social media, and our dependence on it, is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want, biased or not, fair or not. It's the power of the press without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press. And it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against. Think about it. Who was worse: McHenry or the people who made that video public, and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation? Who is worse: Britt McHenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee's bad teeth, or the Twitter masses who call for justice and the return of class -- who express views like, Part of me feels bad for Britt McHenry. Poor thing actually believes she was hired for 'brains' and 'education'? Shouldn't they question whether, in fact, McHenry could have actually been standing up for herself? Sorry to break it to you, but these days, we're all bullies.

But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested.

League One clubs have been informed that there are two nominations for the vacant seat \u2014 Rodwell and former Manchester United director Maurice Watkins, now chairman of Barnsley.

The breakdown in the relationship between the FA and England Supporters Travel Club led to the offensive chants during England\u2019s 1-1 draw with Italy in Turin on Tuesday. The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from \u2018F*** the IRA\u2019, to \u2018F*** the Taliban\u2019 to \u2018F*** the English FA\u2019 \u2014 the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues.

Boffins are currently working towards digitally recreating the cognitive abilities of the Apis Mellifera or European Honeybee. Their final aim is to build a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like the tiny insects. Scientists are working towards building a robot that thinks, senses and acts just like a honeybee Professor James Marshall said if they were able to recreate a fraction of the honeybees ability they would have made 'tremendous advances' The artificial brain is being created by the Green Brain Project, which is a collaboration between researchers from the Universities of Sheffield and Sussex. One day it is hoped the remote controlled machines could be used to pollinate crops or even assist on search and rescue missions. 'Bees and all other insects are miracles of engineering which we are nowhere near equalling,' Professor James Marshall reportedly told the BBC. 'If we could even recreate a fraction of their abilities in a robot system then we would have made a tremendous advance.' Building an artificial brain is a complex process and so far, scientist have only managed to clone the part of the bee's brain which allows it to see. To do this they mapped out the  brain of the honeybee and recreated it with circuits that fire on and off in an organic brain, Discovery Magazine reported. The software is then uploaded into the drone's circuitry which enables it to  fly around in a similar fashion to the bee. The projects team now has three quadcopters and one ground robot, each with unique abilities and configurations. Tests are being carried out in a dedicated flying room based at the University of Sheffield. In a video footage showing initial tests the drone, powered by the artificial bee brain, can be seen flying down a corridor. On the Green Brain website it states: 'Since the start of the project, the GB team has setup the lab, built and tested our robots, and begun to demonstrate some sophisticated visual-based navigation and cognitive functions through embodiment. 'Current projects include navigation using the GB models, flight tests of our models with the BeeBot quadcopter, developing a Ground Control Station, initial testing with the chemosensors and more.'

Fighters from 100 nations \u2013 more than half the countries in the world \u2013 have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to research by the United Nations. Worryingly, the report warned if IS was defeated in the war-torn region then the barbarous foreign fighters could be scattered across the world. Scroll down for video More than 20,000 foreign fighters from more than half the countries in the world have joined militant groups such as Al Qaeda and Islamic State, according to a report by the United Nations The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with over 20,000 foreign fighters travelling to the region to fight for mainly IS but also the Al-Nusra Front. The panel said the thousands of foreign fighters who travelled to both countries are living and working in \u2018a veritable \u201cinternational finishing school\u201d for extremists\u2019 as was the case in Afghanistan in the 1990s. Afghan security forces estimated in March \u2013 three months after British troops withdrew - that about 6,500 foreign fighters were active in the country. And it said hundreds of foreigners are fighting in Yemen, Libya and Pakistan, around 100 in Somalia, and others in the Sahel countries in northern Africa, and in the Philippines. The panel of experts monitoring UN sanctions against Al-Qaeda said in the report that the scale of the problem has increased over the past three years and the flow of foreign fighters \u2018is higher than it has ever been historically\u2019. The number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by a staggering 71 per cent between the middle of 2014 and March 2015 after IS gained significant territory The overall number of foreign terrorist fighters has \u2018risen sharply from a few thousand ... a decade ago to more than 25,000 today,\u2019 the panel said in the report to the UN Security Council. A military defeat of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq could have the unintended consequence of scattering foreign terrorist fighters across the world, the panel said. It noted that the \u2018watch list\u2019 in Turkey - a key crossing point to Syria and Iraq - now includes 12,500 individuals. And while governments are focusing on countering the threat from fighters returning home, the panel said it\u2019s possible that some may be traumatised by what they saw and need psychological help. Others may be recruited by criminal networks. The number of countries the fighters come from has also risen dramatically from a small group in the 1990s to over 100 today, including some that have never had previous links with Al-Qaeda associated groups, the panel said. It cited the \u2018high number\u2019of foreign fighters from Tunisia, Morocco, France and Russia, the increase in fighters from the Maldives, Finland and Trinidad and Tobago, and the first fighters from some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Syria and Iraq were by far the biggest destinations, with fighters mainly travelling to the region to fight for  IS but also the Al-Nusra Front (pictured, a fighter from the Al-Qaeda linked militant group) The panel said the fighters and their networks \u2018pose an immediate and long-term threat\u2019 and \u2018an urgent global security problem\u2019 that needs to be tackled on many fronts and has no easy solution. With globalised travel, it said, the chance of a person from any country becoming a victim of a foreign terrorist attack \u2018is growing, particularly with attacks targeting hotels, public spaces and venues\u2019. But the panel noted that a longstanding terrorist goal is \u2018generating public panic\u2019 and stressed that the response needs to \u2018be measured, effective and proportionate.\u2019 It said the most effective policy is to prevent the radicalization, recruitment and travel of would-be fighters. The panel noted that less than 10 per cent of basic information to identify foreign fighters has been put in global systems and called for greater intelligence sharing.", "reference": "number of foreign fighters worldwide soared by 71 % from mid-2014 to now . syria and iraq were most popular regions - mainly for is and al-nusra front . united nations report said fighters came from over half world 's countries . it warned if is was defeated foreign fighters could scatter across the globe .", "sentences": ["more than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to syria and iraq .", "more than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to syria and iraq .", "they have joined militant groups such as al qaeda and islamic state .", "they have joined militant groups such as al qaeda and islamic state ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"more than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to syria and iraq .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"more than 20,000 foreign fighters have fled to syria and iraq .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"they have joined militant groups such as al qaeda and islamic state .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"they have joined militant groups such as al qaeda and islamic state .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["coreference error", "coreference error", "no error", "no error"]}

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?.' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'", "reference": "residents at hebrew care home in new york are woken by video recordings from loved ones to help ease their confusion and agitation . idea was inspired by the 2004 film 50 first dates starring adam sandler . experiment will be evaluated next month but results are ` very positive ' .", "sentences": ["hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home will ease their confusion , forgetfulness and agitation .", "the idea is borrowed from the 2004 adam sandler film 50 first dates , in which drew barrymore 's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day .", "a suitor , played by sandler , uses videos to remind her of him ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n{\"sentence\": \"hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home will ease their confusion , forgetfulness and agitation .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n{\"sentence\": \"the idea is borrowed from the 2004 adam sandler film 50 first dates , in which drew barrymore 's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n{\"sentence\": \"a suitor , played by sandler , uses videos to remind her of him .\", \"reason\": \"coreference error\", \"category\": \"coreference error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "entity error", "coreference error"]}

The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra \u00a3334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis. Disgraced former RBS boss  Fred Goodwin (pictured) was among those courted by former prime minister Tony Blair. Mr Goodwin was knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004 but was stripped of his title in 2012 Chief executive Ross McEwan said: \u2018This is going to be another tough year. There are still many conduct and litigation hurdles looming on the horizon. We look forward to the day we can focus entirely on the future rather than dealing with legacy issues.\u2019 The latest news wiped more than \u00a3700million off the value of RBS as shares fell more than 3 per cent to 338.5p. The Tories have blamed the last Labour government for failing to keep the banks in check during its 13 years in power. The disgraced former boss of RBS, Fred Goodwin, was among those courted by former prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Mr Goodwin \u2013 nicknamed Fred the Shred for his ruthless cost-cutting \u2013 was even knighted for \u2018services to banking\u2019 in 2004. He was stripped of his title in 2012. Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers\u2019 Alliance, said: \u2018These losses are enormous and will unnerve taxpayers desperate to get rid of the liabilities for the troubled bank. \u2018It\u2019s clear that the banks were badly regulated and took extremely risky decisions that left taxpayers with extraordinary burdens, so it remains crucial that RBS gets back in the black as soon as is practically possible.\u2019", "reference": "rbs has racked up # 50billion in losses since it was bailed out by taxpayers . state-back giant warned that it faces ` another tough year ' to come . lurched to a # 446million loss for the first three months of the year .", "sentences": ["rbs UNK UNK loss for first three months of the year .", "rbs had been forced to put aside UNK to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided .", "the loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"rbs UNK UNK loss for first three months of the year .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"rbs had been forced to put aside UNK to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided .\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"the loss is a blow to taxpayers , who own 80 per cent of the bank , and comes at an awkward time .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "out-of-context error", "no error"]}

In a country where a significant majority of citizens live in poverty, the self-styled Mirreyes (my kings), with their champagne and sports cars, are increasingly exposing the amount of wealth concentrated into a relatively small number of hands. Mirreyes, which refers to individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' and are 'placed above all others', post pictures of luxuries with a hashtag of the same name. Scroll down for video Ballers and shotcallers: Mirreyes are often the sons and daughters of the members of Mexican high society Laying out and living it up: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes showcase luxurious vacation spots It's just one big fiesta: A glance through the social media profile of a Mirrey often reveals a party picture Bling: Good clothes, nice watches and a flashy style are almost prerequisites for becoming one of the Mirreyes Ready for takeoff: An expert on the subject of Mirreyes said 'the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts' Three for the money:\u00a0Mirreyes' displays of wealth can  lead to political and legal advantages down the road They are often the sons and daughters of government officials, wealthy businessman and other members of Mexican high society and although their displays of wealth can be embarrassing, they can also lead to political and legal advantages,\u00a0Maclean's\u00a0reported. One such individual, the eldest son of then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a cruise ship off the coast of Brazil during the 2014 World Cup and vanished without a trace, Before he jumped off the ship's 15th floor and disappeared beneath the waves, 29-year-old Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores told his friends to take cellphone videos of his leap. He said: 'I'll stop this cruise, I'll make history.' L\u00f3pez got his wish as the boat stopped for two hours to search for him, according to Vivelo Hoy. His story is not the only example of the celebration of excess gone wrong. In 2012, the\u00a0daughter of oil workers' union boss Carlos Romero Deschamps was brought into the spotlight for posting photos of her luxury lifestyle, including Gucci bags and expensive wine, on Facebook. Her flashy pictures did not sit well in a country where people work an average of 2 226 hours a year and households take in an average of $12,850 per year after taxes. Their stories are just examples of what the author of a book about Mirreyes called the Mexican 'Generation Me'. Keeping time: People often post pictures of watches and other luxuries like designer bags and or alcohol Rought: In Mexico, the images of wealth are shocking as households take in an average of $12,850 per year Symbol: Jorge Alberto L\u00f3pez Amores (right), who likely died after jumping off a boat, is an example of a Mirrey Purchasing power: Mirreyes might not even think twice about spending hundreds of dollars on a stuffed bear Selfie star: L\u00f3pez, the son of\u00a0then-Chiapas Attorney General Raciel Lopez Salazar, jumped off a yacht in 2014 No need to pimp my ride: Mirreyes obtain cash from sources like inheritance, theft, corruption or the lottery Kiss the bling: Many of the photos posted by Mirreyes will either have a shiny watch, fancy champagne, or both The author of Mirreynato, the Other Inequality,\u00a0Ricardo Raphael, wrote in his book: 'The economic wealth Mirreyes use is the main marker of class. 'No matter where the money comes - work, inheritance, theft, corruption or lottery- the key is the purchasing power the Mirrey boasts'. By identifying themselves as Mirreyes on social media, these seemingly spoiled brats are possibly creating connections which could be important for business and politics in the future because money attracts powerful friends. They are certainly being noticed. In 2011, a \u00a0a website called Mirrreybook was created by Pepe Ceballos. He began posting photos of mMirreyes on the site and it quickly became popular. Ceballos said: 'Mirreyes, who don't have anything to do with narcos [narcotics traffickers], seem like they're competing with them to see who has more. 'We've suddenly seen it in the kind of fashion or the bling-bling. There's more influence from the narcos.' In a recent source of embarrassment, Mirreyes were also featured in a controversial video that showcased the class of 2015 from private school Instituto Cumbres in Mexico City. In the professionally-produced video, well-dressed male students were shown drinking alcohol while carrying out a casting call with young women who dance, strip and wash their feet. Popping bottles: Mirreyes are individuals who enjoy 'ostentatious spending, exhibitionism and narcissism' The flash and the not-so-furious: Members of this select group seem to have few reasons to be upset with life Up in smoke: Some Mirreyes post photos implying they have something in common with narcotics traffickers Look at me: The selfie has become somewhat of a status symbol and Mirreyes frequently use them to show off Future endeavors:\u00a0By identifying themselves on social media, Mirreyes are possibly creating good connections The all-male  Catholic school was accused of sexism and promoting privilege after the video began to spread across the internet, according to the\u00a0National Catholic Reporter. The school issued an apology late last month. It said: 'The Cumbres Institute Mexico asks for an apology for the content of the video that offended various persons, who have expressed anger. 'This video in no way represents the values and principles of the school, students, families and graduates. ''The necessary measures are being taken with the students involved and to establish rules so that it does not occur again.'

{"doc_id": "16679938", "source": "bbc", "split": "test", "model": "BERTS2S", "transcript": "As Ron Jones, from Newport, prepares to mark Holocaust Memorial Day on Friday with a service at the city's cathedral, he says that amongst all the terrible memories, there will also be a few which will make him smile.He was captured in 1943 fighting in the Middle East, and after nine months in Italy, was transferred to forced labour camp E715, part of the Auschwitz complex.There he spent 12 hours a day, six days a week, working with hazardous chemicals in the IG Farben works, but on Sundays they were permitted to play football.I think the Germans thought that letting us play football was a quick and easy way of keeping us quiet, he said.The Red Cross would bring us food parcels, and when they heard about our football, they managed to get us strips for four teams: England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. I was always the Wales goalkeeper.It kept us sane, it was a bit of normality, but it sounds wrong somehow to say I've got fond memories of playing football, considering what was going on just over the fence.He says as well as keeping up spirits, football played a major role in his survival, and that of many of his fellow prisoners, when they were forced on one of the series of extremely long marches westwards from PoW camps during the final stages of the conflict.Whilst many of Mr Jones's friends died on the march, he believes it is no coincidence that those who had been involved in the Auschwitz football league fared better.You could say the football we'd played saved our lives. The football lads were fitter, yes, but more than that, they belonged to a group which kept each other going on the march.E715 was located close to Auschwitz III, Monowitz, which held mainly Polish resistance fighters, political dissidents, homosexuals and some captured Soviet troops.Whilst this was not officially a death camp, Mr Jones says it did not take long for him to realise that the inmates at Monowitz were far from safe.In the nights you could hear shots coming from Monowitz, he said.Not bursts like you had when you were fighting, but deliberate, regular every few seconds; like they had a system going.We didn't know who they were or why they'd been killed, and we couldn't help but be terrified that we'd be next.But when the British PoWs were allowed out to play football, they would be taken to fields next to Auschwitz II, Birkenau, where killing was on an altogether more industrial scale.The first Sunday we went to the playing fields, we saw these people - well walking skeletons they were really - digging trenches, he said.We asked, 'Who are those poor sods?' and the German guards shout 'Juden', Jews, as if it had been a stupid question.We could only play in the summer, because everything was covered in snow through the winter. But when it was hot, this awful stench would waft across from the crematoriums.Your imaginations pretty much filled in the gaps for you, but we'd carry on playing football.Scoring a goal, making a save or arguing about an offside was the only way you could stop yourself from cracking up.Mr Jones says he has spent a great deal of time since the war wondering about how much his German guards had known and cared about what was going on inside Birkenau.You have to remember that our guards weren't SS like in Birkenau; they were conscripted squaddies like us, he said.Dozens of them would come and cheer our football matches and have a laugh with us, and if you got them on their own, you could tell that they were ordinary, decent blokes.But if you asked them about Birkenau they'd get angry and scared. 'We didn't need to know', 'they didn't know', 'it was nothing', and even if it was, then 'it wasn't their fault, they weren't SS'.I had nightmares about Auschwitz for years after the war, but I bet mine were nothing compared with what those Germans must have gone through.Some would say they deserve it, but most likely they couldn't have done any more about it than we could have ourselves.As the Red Army closed in, on 21 January, 1945 German guards burst into Mr Jones's hut in the middle of the night, and ordered him to leave immediately with whatever he could carry.The Soviets liberated Auschwitz on 27 January, 1945, confirming for the first time the stories of the Holocaust's mass murder, which the Allies had hitherto rubbished as too extreme to be possible.But by the time the Russians arrived, Mr Jones was long gone; as part of the death march west, which killed anywhere between 3,000 and 8,000 Allied PoWs.We were on the road for 17 weeks, and God knows how many hundreds of miles we traipsed, through Poland, Czechoslovakia, Germany and Austria.I was 13 stone (82kg) when I was captured, and when I was liberated by the Americans in April 1945, they weighed me, and I was seven stone.Mr Jones considers himself one of the lucky ones.I was very lucky. I came home to a good wife, who helped me get over it. But lots never really recovered at all, he said.I think I'm probably the last now. There was another of the footballers who I got Christmas cards from, but there was nothing this year. So at 94, I think it's probably time to tell the story before it's too late.", "reference": "a 94-year-old man who survived a prisoner of war camp next door to the auschwitz-birkenau extermination camp believes a football league which the guards allowed them to set up may have helped save his life.", "sentences": ["football is one of the greatest sporting experiences of all time."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\n        \"sentence\": \"football is one of the greatest sporting experiences of all time.\",\n        \"reason\": \"entity error\",\n        \"category\": \"entity error\"\n    }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

The white-cheeked macaque was discovered in the remote highland forests of south-east Tibet after researchers set up camera traps. The monkey has a distinctive rounded penis rather than the arrow shaped genitalia found on other species in the area. Scroll down for video The white-cheeked macaque, from Tibet, China, has a distinctive rounded penis compared to other macaques Officially named Macaca leucogenys, it earned its common name due to the pale whiskers on its chin and the side of its face. Videos have also revealed that the animal has a distinctive alarm calls compared to other macaques in Tibet. Human males may be preoccupied by the size of their penis, but it is one of the largest in the primate kingdom. An evolutionary biologist has compared the sizes of genitals of humans to gorillas and apes to look at why there is such a discrepancy between the species. He concluded the human penis may have grown so long to make it more conspicuous to potential partners, or even as a way of cooling the body down. The relative size of the male reproductive organs across these species was discussed by evolutionary biologist Darren Curnoe in his latest 'How Did We Get Here?' video series for the University of New South Wales, Australia. Gorillas have small penises and small testicles, while chimps have medium-sized penises and large testicles. By comparison, human males have the longest penis and medium-sized testicles. 'Amazingly the size of the reproductive organs, especially the testicles, are a reflection of how the apes are organised socially,' explained Professor Curnoe. 'Why the difference? Well for the testicles it's pretty straight forward. 'It all comes down to the amount of competition the chimps, and their sperm, have when they mate with females.' But he said there wasn't a discernible reason why there is so much variation in penis size between humans and great apes. Dr Pengfei Fan, one of the researchers who discovered the new species and a biologist at Dali University, Yunnan, in China, said the new macaque had long been misidentified as another species. He said that due to the remoteness of the location in Medog County of Tibet, few biologists had been there. He said: 'Medog County is surrounded by snow mountains and so far away from the centre of science. 'Furthermore, it locates in southeastern Tibet and close to McMahon line which is a political sensitive area. Very few have people studied primates there. 'This species has long been identified as Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis) because no clear photos or good specimens are available.' In an attempt to better study the animals living in the region, Cheng Li, a photographer with the Imaging Biodiversity Expedition in Beijing, set up camera traps in the area's remote tropical and evergreen mountain forests. They captured 685 photos of macaques and Mr Li was also able to follow a group of macaques allowing him to obtain close up images. When the researchers, whose work is published in the American Journal of Primatology, examined the images they started to notice some monkeys that had different features. They the animals hd relatively short hairless tails and almost white hairs around their face. They also had long thick hairs on their neck. But the most distinctive feature was the creatures genitalia. Most macaques from that area have arrow shaped penises. However, Macaca leucogenys had far more rounded penis and a dark hairy scrotum. Scientists noticed some of the macaques captured on by the cameras looked different with shorter tails (like those above) and light coloured markings around their face, leading them to identify a new species of primate The images above show the more usual 'arrow-shaped' genitalia that macaques in the area have Videos also revealed that Macaca leucogenys produced a far higher frequency squeal when threatened compared to the low pitched bark used by Macaca assamensis as an alarm call. Dr Fan said the species seemed to inhabit a diverse range of habitats and was found living in tropical forests at 1,395 metres, evergreen broad-leaved forests at 2,400 metres and a mixed broad leaf and conifer forest at 2,700 metres. However, the researchers, who also included Choa Zhao from the Southwest Forestry University in Kunming, China, warned that the new species may be under threat. They said: 'The white-cheeked macaque is threatened by illegal hunting and the construction of hydropower stations. The white cheeked macaque was discovered in the mountain forests of Medog in south east Tibet, China The researchers say the whiskers on the side of the face of Macaca leucogenys become paler and more prominent with age. Infants can be seen in the images A and B while a juvenile is labelled C. Adult females are in the image D and adult males are seen on the far right of image E. Adults have few dark hairs on their faces 'Discovery of this new primate species further highlights the high value for biodiversity conservation of southeastern Tibet and calls for more intensive surveys, studies, and environmental protection in this area.' Dr Fan added that it was possible there could be other species of primate still to be discovered in the area. He said: 'This area has been little studied. 'Although primates have been intensively studied for decades, two new macaque species (Macaca munzala and M. leucogenys) were discovered and described in this area in the past 10 years. 'As for other species groups that received less attention, We believe there are still some species remain undiscovered. 'It is highly possible that some primate species still remain undiscovered.'

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real \u2013 a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business\u2026 now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time. If Dave doesn't make it we'll get rid of him.' The Tories have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day, but Tories are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late London Mayor Boris Johnson - appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace David Cameron as Tory leader Multimillionaire Tory donor Peter Hall, who has given almost \u00a3600,000 to the Tory party since 2005, meanwhile has criticised Mr Cameron's 'curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign.' He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step. 'It's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose.

Manual inspection was used to check the automatic delineation methods employed in the pictures was correct.We use manual delineation to verify the satellite data because there can be a problem with debris cover on a glacier, explained Ms Gardent.Automatic delineation from satellite data will sometimes say there is no glacier when in fact we know there is one there.  Also, deep shadows can hide the glacier margins.The only existing glacial inventory from the French Alps was published four decades ago within the context of the World Glacier Inventory. It found the overall area of ice to be about 375 sq km.By 1985-86, in spite of a short advancing period in the late 70s/early 80s, glacial coverage had decreased to a value close to 340 sq km, the new survey shows.Since then, the withdrawal has accelerated, with the area being reduced to about 275 sq km in the late 2000s.This represents an average loss of some 26% over the last 40 years. The retreat is not uniform across the French Alps, however.  The greatest losses have been seen in the southern sectors.  In the Belledonne Massif, for example, glaciers have almost completely disappeared; and in the Ecrins Massif, glacial retreat is more than three times stronger than in the Mont Blanc Massif.The glacier retreat is less important in the northern Alps than in the southern Alps, Ms Gardent emphasised.We think this is because of the lower elevation of the mountains in the south, but also because of climatic conditions which are different.  There is more precipitation in the north and there is also more cloud.The northern region includes the biggest French glacier of all - La Mer de Glace, which falls over a 1,000m in altitude down Mont Blanc itself.  Its area today is just over 30 sq km, a shade smaller than the 31.5 sq km in the late 1960s/early 1970s.Efforts to assess and monitor glacier health are going on across the Alpine region.At this very meeting three years ago, Swiss researchers reported that glaciers on their part of the European range were also losing mass at an accelerating rate.Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk", "reference": "glaciers in the french alps have lost a quarter of their area in the past 40 years, according to new research.", "sentences": ["french scientists say they have found a way to hide the earth\\'s vast mountains of mont blanc."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["LinkE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["LinkE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n{\"sentence\": \"french scientists say they have found a way to hide the earth's vast mountains of mont blanc.\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word genocide to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a genocide as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence, he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence.

He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the \u00a31million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides\u00a0Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'", "reference": "crabbie 's grand national takes place at aintree on april 11 . shutthefrontdoor , trained by jonjo o'neill , is the race favourite . ap mccoy is expected to ride shutthefrontdoor at aintree .", "sentences": ["jonjo o'neill has not decided yet whether he is a ' UNK horse ' .", "he has not decided yet whether he is a better horse on a flat track .", "o'neill says he could not be happier with him .", "o'neill says he is a ' UNK horse ' ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "GramE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "OtherE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"jonjo o'neill has not decided yet whether he is a ' UNK horse ' .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"he has not decided yet whether he is a better horse on a flat track .\", \"reason\": \"predicate error\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"o'neill says he could not be happier with him .\", \"reason\": \"no error\", \"category\": \"no error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"o'neill says he is a ' UNK horse ' .\", \"reason\": \"entity error\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "predicate error", "no error", "entity error"]}

In 9% of schools, there was an individual tablet device for every pupil.The highest use of tablet computers was within academy schools - much greater than in independent schools or other types of state schools.The underlying trend is for an increasing number of tablet computers in schools - among those not using them at present, 45% reported that they would soon be likely to introduce them.Between 2014 and 2016, the number of tablet computers in schools is expected to rise from about 430,000 to almost 900,000.But Dr Clarke, formerly of the University of Cambridge's education department, says it is not possible to make a definitive connection between tablet computers and improved results.Researchers cannot isolate the impact of technology as the specific cause of a rise in attainment.But Dr Clarke says head teachers reported a positive impact.And there is evidence that they help to motivate pupils who might otherwise be disengaged - and when pupils take home tablet computers it increases the involvement of families.Dr Clarke says that the role of technology is going to grow in schools.The type of device might change, but it's not going to go away. It will almost seem ridiculous if some of them are not using technology, she said.A separate study from the National Literacy Trust and Pearson, published on Monday, suggested that touch-screen computers were particularly useful in helping boys and poorer pupils to learn to read.It showed children in poorer households were particularly likely to read on touch-screen computers rather than printed books.The study on tablet computers in schools shows how much online technology is part of everyday life for young people.Within a sample of schools where every pupil has a tablet computer, a quarter of secondary pupils described themselves as internet addicts.About two-thirds took a computer device or smartphone to bed with them, used for social media or watching videos.Findings earlier this year from Ofcom show how tablets have spread quickly within families with children.It showed about 70% of five to 15-year-olds had access to a tablet at home.Simon Mason, head of Honywood Community School in Essex, said it was not possible to say whether results are changed by any individual factor, but he is a strong advocate of tablet computers in schools.Each pupil has an iPad, which remains the property of the school, but pupils can take them home.Using these computers, he says, is about making sure that the school is in the current century and not the last.The benefits are difficult to put into league tables, he says. But they create a sense of empowerment for young people and create an ethos in which pupils can feel trusted and valued.Tablets are preferable to laptops, he argues, more portable, the right size, touch-screen and immediately switched on.The head says that the use of technology in school also reflects the reality of how pupils live at home and what they will find at work.I think it's really important that schools function in the way that the world is, said Mr Mason.", "reference": "almost 70% of primary and secondary schools in the uk now use tablet computers, according to research.", "sentences": ["more than half of schools in england are using tablet computers, according to a study from the university of cambridge."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0], "factuality_types": ["NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"more than half of schools in england are using tablet computers, according to a study from the university of cambridge.\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Spahic was substituted in the 90th minute with an ankle injury as Bayer crashed out of the Germany's DFB-Pokal at the quarter-final stage, losing 5-3 on penalties after 120 goalless minutes at the BayArena. But amateur footage from after the game shows the Bosnian defender involved in an altercation with stewards along the side of the pitch, where he had to be restrained by pitchside staff who were believed to have stopped his friends from walking between the stadium's West and East stands. Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic could face a lengthy ban after appearing to fight with stewards After initially being restrained (first photo), Spahic became involved in a clash with staff after the game Spahic later seemed to aim a headbutt at a member of stadium staff, even after the angry clash had died down Spahic is pictured taking on Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm for the ball during the DFB-Pokal quarter-final The incident has been referred to the public prosecutor in Cologne and could now be investigated by police.  Spahic will issue an apology for his behaviour. A Bayer spokesman said: 'It is clear that there has been a physical dispute after the final whistle. We will review the incident and try to clarify now who was there and why they were there.' In the video Spahic, wearing a red club top, is at first restrained by two stewards as members of his group clash with the stadium staff. Spahic is seen breaking away from the clutches of two stewards to assist his friends in the melee Footage shows Spahic seeming to throw his hands into the faces of some of the yellow-jacketed staff After breaking free, the 34-year-old joins the melee and appears to throw his hands into the faces of multiple stewards before aiming a headbutt at another even when the brawl dies down.

{"doc_id": "17592709", "source": "bbc", "split": "test", "model": "BERTS2S", "transcript": "The event on 27 May offers 46- or 95-mile routes snaking through the scenic Trossachs and the Campsie Fells north of Glasgow.The ride will raise money to develop young Scottish cycling talent acknowledge the fabulous contribution made to Scottish and British cycling by Millar, who was born in Glasgow in 1958.His fourth-placed finish in the 1984 Tour de France was a record for a British rider and has since been matched only by Bradley Wiggins in 2009.For three of the organisers, the sportive is the perfect way to celebrate Millar's achievements. They hope it will safeguard his legacy.Billy Bilsland, Brian Smith and David Lang are respected figures in the Scottish cycling scene.Millar was a pupil of Bilsland's at his circuit training classes in Glasgow in the late 1970s.A veteran of the professional continental racing circuit, Bilsland and fellow Glasgow Wheelers stalwart Arthur Campbell helped nurture the fiercely ambitious Millar and set him on his way to France.Smith, now manager of the Endura racing team, trained with Millar when his hero returned home from racing across mainland Europe.He picked up the Scots pro baton that was handed from Bilsland to Millar and raced in the same Motorola team as Lance Armstrong.He is a trusted friend of the enigmatic Scot - and a cycling nut.Didn't I see you win the Glasgow-Dunoon race in the '80s? I wondered.Smith, from Paisley and now based in Kent, replied that he had indeed won, aged 18 and at his first attempt - and he could even remember the gear combination he used in the final 25-mile section.Media playback is not supported on this deviceLang, who captains Millar's former club, the Glasgow Wheelers, said: In my opinion, he is definitely the best stage rider that Britain has ever produced.Yet I'm sure if you stopped most people in the street and asked them who Robert Millar is, most Glaswegians wouldn't know.So we looked at the possibility of setting up a sportive in Robert's honour.He did a lot of his training over the Crow Road, between Lennoxtown and Fintry, and that is the final climb.The circuit also goes over the Tak Me Doon from Kilsyth, which is tough as well.Millar's steely determination and aggressive climbing skills saw him finish fourth in the 1984 Tour de France, as well as securing second places in the Tours of Spain (twice) and Italy.And then there were apparent contradictions: self-deprecating and shy or self-assured; pony-tailed waif or tough as teak; proud of his roots or occasionally dismissive - the Caledonian antisyzygy on two wheels.Lang put it thus: Robert was very much a loner. He was determined to be a world-class cyclist and it didn't really matter who he upset to get there.Bilsland, to whom Millar gifted his 1984 King of the Mountains polka dot jersey which now hangs on the wall of his bike shop, added: Robert was special.He was focused on what he was about. He believed in himself. When he attacked, he attacked to win.I think he was one of the few Scotsmen who ever got their photograph on the front cover of L'Equipe.I believe if he had the backing of the Sky team now, he would have won the Tour.Media playback is not supported on this deviceWhen he was with Peugeot, a lot of the French guys didn't want to ride for him. A lot of the victories he got on his own merit.The sportive, Lang believes, is the first time Millar has allowed his name to be used for a cycling event.The intensely private Millar gave his permission to Smith as long as proceeds went to the Glasgow Wheelers' development squad for young riders and the Braveheart Fund, which Smith established a decade ago to improve young Scottish cyclists' prospects.He was one of my idols, said Smith. He used to come back in the winter to Glasgow. Every year he came round to the house and gave me a jersey.I was fortunate then; I was just as small as him so I could use them.And now, to have a Robert Millar Sportive is fantastic because the legacy of the name will go on.Every hill that you go over will remind you how difficult it was to become King of the Mountains in the biggest annual sporting event in the world.", "reference": "a generation after robert millar mesmerised british tv viewers with his assaults on pyrenean peaks in mid-1980s tours de france, a sportive in his honour will test riders on the roads on which he trained.", "sentences": ["three years after the death of former british tour de france winner robert millar."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n{\"sentence\": \"three years after the death of former british tour de france winner robert millar.\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}
