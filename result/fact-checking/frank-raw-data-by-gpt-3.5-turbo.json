Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London.Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010.The documents say the charity would help the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress.Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable.In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants.The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property.The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation.But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room.One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.It's all about the money, it's not about the people, he added. I thought inspections would be made.Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m.The council said it has a dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable.Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees.He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients.He also said his company was genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property.Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.It also said it did not have authority from the relevant parties to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing.", "reference": "a letting agency has been paid more than # 5.5 m in housing benefit after its owner set up a charity to help the homeless, the bbc has learned.", "sentences": ["a private agency set up by a private agent to rent homes has been paid more than \u00a31m in rent,", "documents obtained by the bbc reveal."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"sentence\": \"a private agency set up by a private agent to rent homes has been paid more than \u00a31m in rent,\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"},\n    {\"sentence\": \"documents obtained by the bbc reveal.\", \"reason\": \"out-of-context error\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error", "out-of-context error"]}

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The bad old days of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of fans have thankfully been left far behind us now.

The figures from the Trussell Trust were seized on by Labour and the TUC as \u2018shocking\u2019 evidence that millions need emergency food because of low pay, the so-called bedroom tax, and stopped benefits. But Tory benefits chief Iain Duncan Smith questioned the numbers, which he said were \u2018unverified\u2019, and insisted that the best way to help families was to get people into work. The Trussel Trust claimed that 1 million people are being fed from food banks such as this one in Glasgow Another independent food bank organisation warned that such figures could be misleading because food banks are a new phenomenon and should not be used as a \u2018political football\u2019. The row comes amid growing controversy over the spread of food banks \u2013 said by supporters to show that hunger is commonplace and need overwhelming, and by critics to show that when free food is handed out, people will always come forward to take it. Yesterday\u2019s report from the Trust put the number of people who were given three days\u2019 worth of food at one of its 445 branches in the past financial year at 1,084,604. Its UK director Adrian Curtis said: \u2018Despite welcome signs of economic recovery, hunger continues to affect significant numbers of men, women and children. The latest figures highlight how vital it is that we all work to prevent and relieve hunger in the UK.\u2019 The latest figures show a slowdown in the numbers visiting food banks, with a rise of under 100,000 in numbers recorded since 2013-14, when there were 913,138 food bank visits. Iain Duncan Smith, pictured, dismissed the suggestion claims suggesting that the Trussell Trust's figures are 'unverified' This figure was almost three times the 2012-13 level of 346,992. In 2009-10 the Trust recorded 40,898 food bank visits. The claims have been disputed because the Trussell Trust counts numbers of food bank visits in which people are given three-day food packages, and not numbers of individuals. This means an unknown number make repeat visits, and some analysts say the real total of people who went to food banks may be closer to half a million. Research carried out by the Trust, Oxfam, the Church of England and other charities last year also found that low pay is only a minor reason for people going to get aide from food banks. It found that more than four out of five users live on state benefits and only one out of 40 users questioned was working on a zero hours contract. A chorus of political leaders and charities lined up to criticise David Cameron over the figures. Labour\u2019s work and pensions spokesman Rachel Reeves said: \u2018The shocking rise in the number of people relying on Trussell Trust food banks since 2010 shows the Tory plan is failing. \u2018David Cameron\u2019s failure to tackle low pay, the bedroom tax and delays in benefit payments have led to over a million people depending on emergency food aid.\u2019 TUC general secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: \u2018This should make all of us ashamed, particularly those who claim everyone is sharing in the recovery. It tells us that the Government has done grave damage to the welfare safety net. \u2018Vicious sanctions and benefit cuts \u2013 even for those who paid in all their working lives \u2013 are destroying the support any of us might need if we lose our job or have an accident.\u2019 Oxfam poverty chief Rachael Orr said: \u2018It is extremely worrying to see yet another rise in the number of people being forced to visit food banks in the UK.\u2019 The picture of millions going hungry contrasts with the findings of the respected US-based Social Progress Index published earlier this month, which put Britain in first place out of 133 countries for its success in conquering hunger. Mr Duncan Smith said the Trust\u2019s figures were \u2018unverified\u2019. He added: \u2018We are not going to take lectures from the party who presided over the deepest recession in living memory \u2013 whose incompetent economic policies hit the poorest harder than anyone. \u2018The best way to help families provide for themselves is cut taxes and to get more people into work \u2013 and we\u2019ve got a strong record there: two million more people in work since the last election. Frances O'Grady, Trade Union Congress general secretary, pictured, described the figure as 'shameful' \u2018It is only by continuing with our term economic plan that will we ensure more people have a job and the economic security that comes with it.\u2019 The Oxford Food Bank, which is independent of the Trussell Trust network, urged caution in the interpretation of food bank figures. The organisation, which distributes food to other charities which provide meals, rather than handing it out to individuals, said: \u2018We think that increasing use of food banks is an unreliable guide to underlying need because food banks are a new phenomenon \u2013 whereas food poverty is not. \u2018As an organisation which draws its volunteers and donors from across the entire population of Oxford, we adopt a non-political stance.
