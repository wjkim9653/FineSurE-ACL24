His wit was incomparable, his writing was dazzling and fearless, his intelligence was matched by compassion.Adrian was a giant among journalists. He was also our friend. We will miss him.Writing about his illness in November, Gill had said he had an embarrassment of cancer, the full English.There is barely a morsel of offal not included. I have a trucker's gut-buster, gimpy, malevolent, meaty malignancy.Writers, broadcasters and journalists have paid tribute to the published author, who was known for dictating his copy over the telephone due to his dyslexia.Jay Rayner, the broadcaster and writer, tweeted that Gill had been a controversialist but also a kind man and a brilliant writer.Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman described Gill as the writer who first made me buy the Sunday Times.The best of us for 30 years has died. Very sombre mood in the office, he added.Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style.John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique.In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine.Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour.Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had trashed him for 20 years, but always did so with magnificently eloquent savagery as well as an irritating kernel of truth.While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy.In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups.In 1998, he described the Welsh as dark, ugly little trolls - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile.In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the hernia on the end of England, while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it smelled of boiled washing.In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a dyke on a bike.He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins.Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer.He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London.He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times.His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991.They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced.Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac.He said he had been surprisingly excited to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as The Blonde in his restaurant reviews.", "reference": "sunday times restaurant critic aa gill has died, aged 62, three weeks after revealing he had cancer.", "sentences": ["writer and broadcaster adrian gill has died at the age of 96, his family has said.", "said he was ``stoical\\'\\'."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE", "OutE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "OtherE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"writer and broadcaster adrian gill has died at the age of 96, his family has said.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms Gill's death but states he was born in 1954 (making him 62 in 2016), and the announcement was made by Sunday Times editor Martin Ivens, not his family.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"said he was ``stoical''.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The quotation \\\"stoical\\\" was used by editor Martin Ivens, but in the summary the implicit subject (linking back to the family) mis-attributes who said it.\",\n    \"category\": \"coreference error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "coreference error"]}

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.' Cardiff City Supporters Club Chairman Clive Francis said, 'Cardiff City Supporters Club fully endorses this decision and is grateful to the Football Club for supporting the stance taken by the various travel groups. 'The bad old days of unacceptable behaviour by a small number of fans have thankfully been left far behind us now.

Leon Yeaman, 55, was allegedly killed by a single punch in the head from 28-year-old shift worker Phillip Pama, 28, during a row in front of their north Brisbane homes. Mr Yeaman was reportedly in his yard on Muller Road making a lot of noise at around 9pm Thursday night. Phillip Pama covered his face as he left Brisbane Magistrate Courts where he was granted conditional bail on Friday Pama, a married father of three, works a 3 am shift at a nearby warehouse and was sleeping at the time Mr Yeaman was making a commotion. Pama\u2019s defence lawyer Bruce Peters said Mr Yeaman was known for getting drunk, playing loud music and yelling at \u2018the world at large\u2019.

If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed.I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'On Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover.Five of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate.'Islamic-themed assemblies'Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board.In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were deep concerns about the way Park View School was run.The letter said: I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement.Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils.I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations, he said.A similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated.Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July.A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels.They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools.What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education, they said.In a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement.Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction, it said.Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July.These included ending less favourable treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more broad and balanced curriculum.Oldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash.A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale.Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology.'Own agendas'The report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate.It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies.Park View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating.Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools.He said there had been upset among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating.This is all about moving forward, what happens next, he said.Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching.When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding.Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and

Abuse campaigners last night angrily questioned why the suspected paedophile was able to remain in the House of Lords if he was too frail to be brought before court. The Crown Prosecution Service has faced widespread criticism since announcing last week that Janner would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease. But now it has emerged that the peer was apparently well enough to sign his name in an April 9 note to Lords authorities. Scroll down for video Controversy: Lord Janner, who will not face child sex charges because he has dementia, with his daughter, rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner Signed: The letter Lord Janner signed on April 9. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons The former Labour MP, 86, claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances in the four years after he was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. He has not attended the Lords since detectives raided his North London home in December 2013. Last October he took a formal leave of absence from Parliament, allowing him to resume his duties after giving three months\u2019 notice. New rules which came into effect last May provide a way for peers to retire permanently while keeping their titles and certain perks. But Janner requested an extension of his leave of absence instead of offering to stand down in the letter sent to a senior Lords official 12 days ago. A House of Lords spokesman confirmed the alleged paedophile signed the note himself, but could not confirm whether the handwriting below the signature was his. Simon Danczuk, the Labour politician who exposed the late Liberal MP Cyril Smith\u2019s horrific abuse of boys, said it was not right for Janner to stay in the Lords yet avoid court. \u2018If you are putting yourself forward to remain a legislator, then surely you are fit enough to be tested before the law,\u2019 he said. \u2018If he has got a leave of absence from the Lords, that implies that he may get well. Why isn\u2019t he retiring? It makes a mockery of it all. He is bringing the House of Lords into disrepute almost single-handedly.\u2019 The Crown Prosecution Service faced widespread criticism after announcing that Janner (pictured) would escape prosecution over child sex allegations because he has Alzheimer\u2019s disease Pete Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, added: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have signed this letter if he was non compos mentis. \u2018But if he isn\u2019t compos mentis, there\u2019s no way he should be anywhere near our legislature. How can they say he\u2019s not fit to stand trial for the most serious of crimes when he himself has argued that age should not be a barrier to prosecuting Nazi war criminals? \u2018It stinks of the Establishment covering up and ensuring he doesn\u2019t have to take the stand in public. This is a cover-up, there can be no question about it.\u2019 Janner\u2019s alleged victims have accused him of preying on boys at care homes around his former Leicester West constituency. He was suspended by Labour after the CPS ruled last Thursday that there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. But Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said he would not be prosecuted because his deteriorating dementia means there could be no criminal conviction. Allegations against the peer were first made public in 1991 during the trial of Frank Beck, a manager of Leicester children\u2019s homes accused of abusing more than 200 boys. After Beck was jailed, many other politicians spoke out in support of Janner in a Commons debate led by Leicestershire North West Tory MP David Ashby. Mr Ashby, 74, who stood down from Parliament in 1997 after being caught up in the Major government\u2019s sleaze scandals, appeared to repeat his backing for the peer yesterday. \u2018Of course I didn\u2019t know anything at the time,\u2019 he said from his home in South-West London. \u2018The man has dementia and should be left alone.\u2019 Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Lord Janner's QC son Prosecutors were forced to defend a senior legal adviser yesterday over fears of a conflict of interest in the Janner case. Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders said she was aware of potential links between a key aide and the Labour peer\u2019s QC son. Neil Moore, who was based at the 23 Essex Street chambers where Daniel Janner works, was consulted by Mrs Saunders before she concluded not to prosecute. Senior police officers have privately raised concerns with her about Mr Moore\u2019s involvement in the decision-making process. But a spokesman for the UK\u2019s top prosecutor said she made the decision alone and that Mr Moore informed her of the connection before any discussions took place. She said Mr Moore was a barrister of the highest integrity and had not spoken to Mr Janner for two years. The potential for a conflict of interest is unhelpful for Mrs Saunders as she tackles the aftermath of her controversial decision.

Nearly 70 years after the end of the conflict, attitudes are reportedly changing among the younger generation. Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling.

Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday.

Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful.

The tasteless repertoire of songs ran from \u2018F*** the IRA\u2019, to \u2018F*** the Taliban\u2019 to \u2018F*** the English FA\u2019 \u2014 the last one due to the huge discontent over the decision to switch double loyalty caps from away trips to home games at Wembley. Those with most caps get priority when buying tickets for big games. The Football Supporters Federation, despite putting out a statement yesterday reaffirming its opposition to abusive chanting, believe it is inevitable that the songs \u2014 and the World War Two favourites \u2014 will be sung when England play the Republic of Ireland in Dublin on June 7. There were offensive chants made by England fans during the game against Italy in Turin on Tuesday - there is no suggestion the fans pictured were involved England's next international is against Ireland and takes place in Dublin on June 7 The FSF are in no mood to work with the FA because of the caps dispute and claim that, having taken legal advice, anti-IRA and WW2 songs are not law-breaking and that the FA showed no interest when the FSF first tackled England fans singing offensive songs in 2005. The FA regard loyalty caps and abusive chanting as two separate issues. Staging Rugby World Cup games at Leicester City\u2019s King Power Stadium rather than the sport\u2019s Welford Road stronghold continues to be a problem for organisers. The loyal Leicester rugby public want little to do with their football neighbours, whose three group fixtures are a long way from being sold out. Radio 5 Live\u2019s loveable football commentator Alan Green was not happy at being asked to pay city tax on checking out of Turin\u2019s Hotel Carlina after the England game. Green was overheard at reception moaning it was BBC\u2019s responsibility to settle the bill and not his. But Green eventually had to cough up\u2026all of seven euros.

{"doc_id": "8610ead0a43054be202a1fc756620415a6d572fe", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "bart", "transcript": "(CNN)Recently, a New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook. What exactly is service of process? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go off the grid. Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is nail and mail service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of service is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, traditional doesn't necessarily mean good.  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be liked by all your gawking friends, we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we live in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.", "reference": "a court allowed a wife to serve divorce papers via facebook . danny cevallos : why not let people be found via social media ? .", "sentences": ["A New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook .", "The idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him .", "Online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"A New York judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via Facebook .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This statement is explicitly stated in the transcript and matches the facts.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"The idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This wording is taken directly from the transcript and is factually consistent.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Online service may be a new frontier , but it 's not unheard of .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This statement matches the transcript verbatim and is correct.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

A total of 238 lots are being sold by Dominic Winter auctioneers at its saleroom in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. Mr Hardy, who lives in the Cotswolds, said that he was sad to sell his collection. 'Downsizing and losing a great part of a treasured library makes for sadness,' he said.

Iraqi officials said Izzat Ibrahim al-Douri had died in fighting with government troops in Salahuddin province, north of Baghdad. Al-Douri, 72, headed the Naqshbandi Order insurgent group, an important faction behind the recent rise of ISIS. Scroll down for video Al-Douri was an Iraqi military commander and was Vice Chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council, until the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq Al-Douri was the King of Clubs in the famous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse He was one of Saddam's most trusted henchmen, helping to lead his 1968 bloodless coup.\u00a0Both Al-Douri and Saddam came from the same Tikriti tribal background. He was then deputy to Saddam when he was deposed following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein on 30 December, 2006, Al-Douri was confirmed as the new leader of the banned Ba'ath Party. Al-Douri was deemed the most high-profile official of Saddam's Ba'ath Party to evade capture after the invasion. He was ranked sixth on the US military's list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis after offensive to overthrow Saddam and had a $10m bounty on his head. He was the King of Clubs in the infamous pack of cards the US issued of wanted members of Saddam's regime after its collapse. His dead body was pictured on social media today with his teeth missing, an unkempt orange beard and a bloody head wound. Salahuddin governor Raed al-Jabouri said soldiers and allied Shia militiamen killed him in an operation east of Tikrit - a city that was recaptured by the government two weeks ago. He said: 'This is a major victory for those involved in the operation. He is considered a mastermind for this terrorist group. 'For sure this will have an impact on them...there will be a break among them.' ISIS currently controls a swath of land slightly larger than the UK, from Aleppo to central Iraq. However, in recent months Iraqi forces, supported by US-led air strikes, have captured large areas from the terrorist group. But today, a car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region that is allied with Washington in a war against Islamic State, which claimed the attack. No U.S. personnel were hurt in the blast, according to the State Department which said a 'vehicle-borne improvised explosive device' exploded right outside the entrance to the heavily fortified compound. Islamic State also claimed responsibility for two car bombings in Baghdad that killed at least 27 people on Friday. 'The fighters of the Islamic State detonated two car bombs in the heart of the Iraqi capital this evening and a third in Erbil,' the group said via its news agency. Such attacks are relatively rare in Kurdistan, which has managed to insulate itself from the worst of the violence afflicting the rest of Iraq. A car bomb killed three people outside the U.S. consulate in Erbil, the capital of Iraq's Kurdistan region, today Kurdish security forces respond to an explosion at the pedestrian entrance to the U.S. Consulate complex In the invasion of Iraq by a US-led coalition, the military developed a set of playing cards to help troops identify the most-wanted members of Saddam's regime. This was mostly high-ranking members of the Iraqi Regional Branch of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party or members of the Revolutionary Command Council. The cards were officially named the 'personality identification playing cards'. Each card contained the wanted person's address and, if available, the job they carried out. The highest-ranking cards, starting with the aces and kings, were used for the people at the top of the most-wanted list.

Steve Esmond, his teenage sons and the teens' mother fell ill more than two weeks ago in St. John, where they were renting a villa at the Sirenusa resort. The family has confidence in their medical professionals and is hopeful for a full recovery, according to a statement released Monday from the family's attorney, James Maron. The teens' mother, Theresa Devine, was treated at a hospital and released, and is in occupational therapy, Maron said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that the presence of a pesticide at the rented villa in St. John may have caused the illnesses, which were reported to the EPA on March 20. Paramedics were called to the villa, which the family was renting. Esmond was found unconscious; the boys and their mother were having seizures, Maron said. The lawyer did not say who called the paramedics. Elias Rodriguez, an EPA spokesman, said the agency's preliminary test results do show that there was a presence of methyl bromide in the unit where the family was staying. Exposure to methyl bromide can result in serious health effects, including central nervous system and respiratory system damage, according to the EPA. The use of the pesticide is restricted in the United States because of its acute toxicity. It's not allowed to be used indoors. Only certified professionals are permitted to use it in certain agricultural settings. For example, the pesticide is injected into the soil of some U.S. strawberry fields, said Judith Enck, an EPA regional administrator. We trust that the strawberry producers are making sure that there's not excess pesticide residue on strawberries, Enck said. You definitely want to wash them really good. This is a pesticide that's been around for a long time, and ironically because of its impact and damage to the ozone layer, it's being phased out because of the air impacts of this fumigant, Enck added. Field workers at a Connecticut nursery were poisoned by the chemical in 1990, according to the Journal of Industrial Medicine. In 2011, warehouse workers in California fell ill after exposed to grapes imported from Chile fumigated with methyl bromide, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said many parts of the world banned the chemical, a neurotoxin. The agent is to be used only outdoors. The chemical is also odorless and colorless, Gupta said. It's not something that you would have any warning of, Gupta said. The chemical is often mixed with tear gas so people can be aware of its presence, he added. The EPA said it is working with local government agencies to investigate whether the family was made ill after a fumigation at the resort on March 18 and whether any environmental regulations or laws were violated. Enck, the EPA regional administrator, said paramedics were called early on March 20. Sea Glass Vacations, which acts as a rental agent for several units at Sirenusa, said the unit directly below the one where the family stayed was recently treated for pests, but that the family's unit was not treated. The company said it licensed an outside company, Terminix, for the pest control services. On Monday, it ended its contract with Terminix. In an email to CNN before the termination, a spokesman for Terminix wrote that the company is committed to performing all work ... in a manner that is safe for our customers, employees, the public and the environment and is looking into this matter internally, and cooperating with authorities. The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a criminal investigation. Many questions remain why an odorless pesticide of this level of toxicity could be manufactured, distributed and applied in a residential area resulting in this family's injuries, Maron said. The attorney added: The family is confident that the responsible parties will be brought to justice and held accountable.

Abase Hussen \u2013 who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join IS earlier this year \u2013 conceded the teenager was \u2018maybe\u2019 influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group Al-Muhajiroun. Mr Hussen told MPs last month, after his daughter Amira Abase fled to Syria aged 15, that he could think of \u2018nothing\u2019 to explain why she and two friends had decided to join IS, as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism. Scroll down for video Abase Hussen, left, took his daughter Amira, right, to a demonstration when she was aged just 13 Abase Hussen, circled, \u00a0marched at the head of a violent rally held by Muslim extremists in London in 2012 It then emerged he had been in caught in shocking video footage amid a flag-burning mob, screaming in rage at a protest outside the US embassy in London, in 2012. Also at the rally were hate cleric Anjem Choudary and Michael Adebowale, one of the killers of Fusilier Lee Rigby. He has now apologised for attending, but admitted going to two further rallies \u2013 with his impressionable daughter in tow. One took place outside the Saudi embassy in London, in 2013, and is said to have been organised by the Islamic extremist group Al-Muhajiroun, founded by hate cleric Omar Bakri Mohammed and linked to many Islamic terror atrocities of the past decade. Yesterday Mr Hussen, who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife Fetia, conceded they might have influenced the youngster, who would have been 13 at the time. \u2018The only reason we took her first time, was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go,\u2019 he said. The rally was held against the treatment of Ethiopians in Saudi Arabia after human rights violations, and Mr Hussen, 47, who is from Ethiopia, said: \u2018We both lost many people back home, we wanted to try to get help for people back home, too many human rights violations there. Many died. Maybe it influenced her.\u2019 Amira was one of three girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London who flew to Turkey before being smuggled across the border into Syria in February. Soon after, in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee, Mr Hussen blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to Syria. Asked by chairman Keith Vaz if Amira had been exposed to any extremism, Mr Hussen replied: \u2018Not at all. Nothing.\u2019 Yesterday respected analyst Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King\u2019s College London, tweeted: \u2018Remember that Amira Abase\u2019s father blamed the police for his daughter going to Syria and effectively misled Parliament with this nonsense.\u2019 Mr Hussen told The Times yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag-burning rally. He said: \u2018I went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted, my faith. Protesting is not radical, it is our right.\u2019 Amira Abase, pictured, was one of three girls who flew from Gatwick to Turkey before crossing to Syria Asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob, he said: \u2018The crowd pushed me. I feel tricked. I did not know who they [the organisers] were. I just followed the crowd, I feel ashamed.\u2019 Mr Hussen came to Britain from Germany in 1999 and said he came \u2018for democracy, for the freedom, for a better life for children, so they could learn English\u2019. He said he was upset with his daughter joining IS, saying she was \u2018just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists\u2019. Mr Hussen said he felt \u2018terrible\u2019 to know he had been protesting with one of Mr Rigby\u2019s killers and said: \u2018It was brutal, it has nothing to do with Islam, it is not human. You don\u2019t do things like this.\u2019 Amira fled to become a \u2018jihadi bride\u2019 with her friends Shamima Begum, 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16.

And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as\u00a0Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me. And with 36 holes here to go, anything can happen.'", "reference": "lindsey vonn was back at augusta friday to watch boyfriend tiger woods play in the second round of the masters . vonn looked stressed at times though woods played a solid round , carding a three-under-par 69 . woods is still well behind the leader , hot young american star jordan spieth . the 21-year-old broke the 36 hole record on friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament , 12 strokes ahead of woods . spieth led after three rounds last year and finished second at the tournament . if spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in masters history with woods .", "sentences": ["lindsey vonn was back at augusta on friday to watch boyfriend tiger woods play in the second round of the masters .", "woods is still well behind the leader , 21-year-old jordan spieth , with 36 holes left to play .", "woods carded a three-under-par 69 in friday 's second round .", "if spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in masters history with woods ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"lindsey vonn was back at augusta on friday to watch boyfriend tiger woods play in the second round of the masters .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Transcript states that Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta on Friday to watch Tiger Woods in the second round of the Masters.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"woods is still well behind the leader , 21-year-old jordan spieth , with 36 holes left to play .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Transcript indicates Woods was 12 strokes behind 21-year-old Jordan Spieth with 36 holes remaining.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"woods carded a three-under-par 69 in friday 's second round .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Transcript explicitly says Woods carded a three-under-par 69 in Friday\u2019s second round.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"if spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in masters history with woods .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Transcript notes that Spieth would tie the record for the youngest Masters winner with Woods if he wins.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

The 22-year-old, from Melbourne, was jogging along a street in the rural southern Oklahoma city of Duncan in August 2013, when he was shot in the back with a .22 calibre handgun. His parents, Donna and Peter Lane listened to the frantic seven-minute 911 emergency phone call made by Oklahoma resident who witnessed their son collapsed on the side of the road. Chancey Luna, 17, was charged with  first-degree murder. The teen was riding in a Ford Focus with two teenage friends when he allegedly pulled the trigger as the vehicle drove past.

Joy Smith: No he's [gasping noise], that's all he's doing, making that noise. 9-11: All right, you just stay on the line with me, OK? Joy Smith: If you don't hurry, he's gone. 9-11: Ma'am, they're coming OK, I can't make them come any faster. Joy Smith: Oh my gosh how long's it going to be? He's stopped breathing. Mr Lane, who was on a baseball scholarship with Oklahoma's East Central University, was visiting his girlfriend in Duncan when he was randomly gunned down. Family and friends, including Mr Lane's former girlfriend Sarah Harper, heard details about how two bystanders tried to resuscitate the young man who had stopped breathing and wept during the proceedings at the Duncan's District Court on Wednesday. Members of the family broke into loud, uncontrolled sobs when authorities showed the white baseball cap Lane wore when he was shot and photographs of the bullet wound taken in a hospital morgue. Linda Prior cried as she told court how she attempted to shut Lane's 'big brown eyes' but wasn't able to after failing to resuscitate him. 'The big brown eyes were just staring at me,' Ms Prior, who has first aid training and performed CPR, told the court.

Another local, Richard Rhoades, who also tried to help Lane, said he took off his shirt to place it over Lane's face when they realised he was dead. 'I just thought it would be nice to close his eyes,' he said. Luna's lawyer, Jim Berry, made a shock admission in court on Tuesday that his client had fired the bullet that killed Lane but added the teen was 'reckless' and was only trying to 'scare the jogger'. The lawyer told the jury that for Luna to be found guilty of first degree murder, the prosecution would have to prove beyond reasonable doubt the murder was premeditated. Prosecutors said Luna internationally pulled the trigger. The trial continues.

Jason Cotterill, 42, plagued his victim with abusive messages over the internet after she tried to end their relationship in October last year. A court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on to her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes, Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard. He and the victim had attended the same school when they were children but got back in contact through Facebook in 2013. They met up for three dates between January and September 2013 but had sex on just one occasion. The court was told that\u00a0the mother - a former sex worker - immediately regretted the liaison and told her lover she did not want to see him again. Soon afterwards she began receiving 'creepy' messages from the defendant,\u00a0saying he loved her and wanted to be with her. As a result, she\u00a0'unfriended' him on Facebook and changed her mobile phone number. During the trial the woman told the court he set up 67 different Facebook in an attempt to contact her after she blocked him on the social networking site. She said: 'He started setting up different profiles on Facebook to send me messages. He also sent my family messages and my friends messages because he couldn't get to me. 'I was very upset, it drove me insane, it made me depressed. I'm on medication. 'His language was absolutely disgusting. He was asking me why I wasn't playing any more, calling me names.' The victim said Cotterill found pictures of her on the internet that he threatened to send to her family and friends. He sent more than one to her daughter, she said. Birmingham Magistrates' Court heard he also emailed the woman a link to an online sex video she was in - and threatened to post it on her Facebook page. Cotterill knew his victim from childhood and knew that she had been previously involved in making sex tapes In October last year, Cotterill sent the victim a link to an x-rated explicit video with a message that said: 'F**k it, I'm going to have it as my profile picture'. He also taunted the victim on Facebook, telling her: 'I am going to send some more pictures too because it's fun lol.' The 42-year-old was 'driven insane' and suffered depression and panic attacks after Cotterill spent a year sending 'disgusting' messages. David Houldcroft, defending, said Cotterill, who had two previous\u00a0convictions for harassment, accepted sending the link and that it would have caused her upset. Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting his victim 'He regrets that and understands that he has problems with relationships,' Mr Houldcroft said. 'He suffers from depression and has alcohol issues. He\u00a0recognises that he needs help.' Cotterill, of Oldbury, was jailed for 12 weeks and had previously been found\u00a0guilty of harassment following a trial. As well as being jailed, he was also banned indefinitely from contacting\u00a0his victim. District Judge David Robinson said: 'You harassed the complainant over a\u00a0three-month period and used social networks constantly in a threatening\u00a0manner to get her to re-engage with you. 'There are a number of aggravating features in this case. 'You sought to use dozens of Facebook profiles to get in touch with her,\u00a0you also found a link to a pornographic site and made use of that. 'You either involved or threatened to involve others, sending the link to\u00a0the woman's friends and her sister, insinuating that her children might get\u00a0to see the photos.

The law, signed by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback on Tuesday, bans what it describes as dismemberment abortion and defines as knowingly dismembering a living unborn child and extracting such unborn child one piece at a time from the uterus. Supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step, while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. The law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur, but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy. The law allows for the procedure if necessary to protect the life or health of the mother, according to a statement on Brownback's website. On Twitter, Brownback, a Republican, said he was proud to sign a law protecting life at its most vulnerable stage. Planned Parenthood Advocates of Kansas and Mid-Missouri sharply criticized the move, which it described as the latest in a series of extreme political measures aimed at denying women access to health care and at undermining their decision-making ability. Kansas is now not only the sole state with this atrocious law; it also now has more restrictions on abortion than any state in the U.S., the advocacy group said in a Facebook post. Both sides appear to be prepared to take their battle over such measures to other states -- and to court. Carol Tobias, the president of National Right to Life, said in a statement that the Kansas law was the first of what her organization hopes will be many state laws. This law has the power to transform the landscape of abortion policy in the United States, she said. Julie Burkhart,  CEO of Wichita-based South Wind Women's Center, said on Twitter that the signing of the law marked a sad day for Kansas and the United States. This law puts women at risk and ties doctors' hands, she said. We'll continue to fight!

It was a soft one, with Lobzhanidze, the visitors' scrum-half, darting down the blind-side of a scrum where Seymour should have halted him, but didn't.The wing made amends soon after when Hogg dinked a kick behind the Georgian defence for Seymour to run on to. In the foot-race, Seymour beat Lobzhanidze to the touch-down. It was questionable that Seymour got downward pressure on the ball, but the try was given and Scotland went ahead when Laidlaw swept over the conversion from the touchline.The floodgates began to open. Scotland owned possession and territory and got their reward when a rolling maul, destined for the try-line, was hauled to the floor by the Georgian lock, Kote Mikautadze. Scotland got a penalty try, converted by Laidlaw, and Mikautadze got the sin-bin.Merab Kvirikashvili landed a penalty but Scotland motored on regardless. Maitland scored after multiple Scotland phases and Laidlaw added the conversion and a penalty just after. There were 30 minutes gone and Scotland had 91% possession.Media playback is not supported on this deviceGeorgia, living off scraps, put over another penalty to make it 24-11 but Hogg's try stretched the lead again. There was ambition and luck at its heart. There was nothing on for the full-back, so he chanced his arm, dinked a kick over the top and chased like hell.The breaking ball took a vicious bounce away from the covering Alexandre Todua and landed kindly in the onrushing Hogg's hands. Away he went for Scotland's fourth try, once again converted from out wide by Laidlaw.The fifth came early in the second half, Watson coming round the corner of a scrum and blasting his way over. The conversion made it 38-11. It was the belated catalyst for Georgia to get some ball of their own. They scored their second try when shoving Scotland to kingdom come in the scrum. They shunted their hosts over their own line and the dot down for Lobzhanidze was a formality.Georgia's scrum continued to cause a newly disjointed and error-prone Scotland problems. Moray Low was yellow-carded in the midst of this for another buckled scrum. The hosts had a rousing finish, though.Ali Price was only three minutes into his debut when he tapped a penalty and went from deep in his own half. Rory Hughes, another substitute, was on Price's shoulder and he in turn found Hogg who ran in his second and Scotland's sixth.Scotland head coach Vern Cotter: It was a good first half. We scored three pretty quick tries, and we held the ball so they couldn't access the game as they would have liked.

Therefore, the total benefit payout is higher than the rent fee passed on to the property's landlord.Both Investing Solutions and Fresh Start are based in the same building, a storage unit in south London.Records held at Companies House show Investing Solutions was set up in 2002 by Samir Patel, who then set up Fresh Start Housing in 2010.The documents say the charity would help the needs of current and ex-offenders with a wider goal to reduce poverty, sickness and distress.Operating across seven London boroughs, Investing Solutions is one of the largest recipients of housing benefit in the UK, making the venture hugely profitable.In one property we visited, Investing Solutions was claiming \u00a32,114 per month in housing benefit for two tenants.The owner of the house was getting \u00a31,150 per month, giving the agency an annual gross profit of \u00a311,568 on the one property.The company focuses on providing housing to single homeless men over the age of 35, saying that is because this is the group facing the greatest challenges in accessing accommodation.But housing benefit legislation allows people aged 35 and over to be housed in private rather than shared accommodation. In the boroughs in which Investing Solutions operates, that means they can charge up to \u00a3260 per week for each private room.One of the tenants, Nigel McCann, was living in a homeless shelter when he was referred to Fresh Start Housing. They passed him to Investing Solutions who housed him in several properties that he describes as wholly unsuitable - various problems included lack of heating and hot water, rats and damp.He says he had to remove 28 bags of rubbish from one house to begin to make it habitable.Mr McCann said he became aware of how profitable Investing Solutions was after he did some work for them in 2014.It's all about the money, it's not about the people, he added. I thought inspections would be made.Nearly half the money that Investing Solutions has received over the past two years has been paid by Wandsworth Council in south London, which has paid the lettings agency more than \u00a32.1m.The council said it has a dedicated Private Sector Housing Team who provide specialist advice to both landlords and tenants to ensure the private rented sector in the borough is safe, secure and affordable.Matt Downie, of homeless charity Crisis, said: We've heard many examples of poor practice amongst letting agents as well as good practice. But this idea of having a charity tacked on to poor practice is a new low.Samir Patel said in a statement that Fresh Start Housing was an independent charity with its own board of trustees.He also said the majority of the properties used were sourced from private sector landlords who, to make exceedingly clear, own the properties. The simple point being, the bulk of the rents gets passed to our private sector landlord clients.He also said his company was genuinely concerned by some of your allegations concerning the state of one of our landlord client's property.Fresh Start Housing told us it had housed 788 homeless people since it was founded and 222 homeless people in the last 12 months, including re-housed tenants.It also said it did not have authority from the relevant parties to reveal how many were housed with Investing Solutions.A spokeswoman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said local authorities were responsible for rigorously safe-guarding taxpayers' money, with dedicated investigations and inspection teams for private sector housing.", "reference": "a letting agency has been paid more than # 5.5 m in housing benefit after its owner set up a charity to help the homeless, the bbc has learned.", "sentences": ["a private agency set up by a private agent to rent homes has been paid more than \u00a31m in rent,", "documents obtained by the bbc reveal."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a private agency set up by a private agent to rent homes has been paid more than \u00a31m in rent,\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Investing Solutions, a private letting agency founded by Samir Patel, has received at least \u00a32.1 m from Wandsworth Council alone\u2014so the claim it has been paid \\\"more than \u00a31 m\\\" is true (though conservative) and nothing in the sentence contradicts the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"documents obtained by the bbc reveal.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript never says the BBC obtained any documents, so attributing the information to \\\"documents obtained by the BBC\\\" introduces information not present in the source.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "out-of-context error"]}

Is my science of a level consistent with other people who have gotten the Nobel? Yes, he was once quoted as saying.And he is a very wealthy user of Lear Jets and private yachts.But his efforts in the field of human genomics have undeniably helped speed up the entire process.After the publication of the human genome, Dr Venter turned his attention to another grand project: the creation of a synthetic life form.Scientists at the US-based J Craig Venter Institute have been busily working on the endeavour for more than a decade. They have now published details of the result, an organism called Synthia, in the prestigious journal Science.Born in 1946, as a boy, Dr Venter did not exemplify good scholarship and at 18 he chose to devote his life to the surfing pleasures of the beaches in Southern California. Three years later, in 1967, he was drafted into the Vietnam conflict.As an orderly in the naval field hospital at Da Nang, he tended to thousands of soldiers wounded during the Tet offensive.This inspired two important changes in him: a determination to become a doctor and a conviction that time should never be wasted.Life was so cheap in Vietnam. That is where my sense of urgency comes from, he said.During his medical training he excelled in research rather than practice. By the 1980s, the early days of the revolution in molecular biology, he was working at the government-funded US National Institute of Health and soon realised the importance of decoding genes.But the work was messy, tedious and agonisingly slow. So, in 1987, when he read reports of an automated decoding machine, he soon had the first one in his lab. This speeded things up - but not enough.Then came Dr Venter's real breakthrough. He realised that he did not need to trawl the entire genome to find the active parts, because cells already use those parts naturally.He switched his attention from the DNA blueprint to the messenger molecules (called RNA) that a cell makes from that blueprint. He was then able to churn out gene sequences at unprecedented rates.His success shocked some, most notably the co-discoverer of DNA, James Watson, who famously dismissed the relatively crude results obtained as work any monkey could do.The criticism, and the failure to secure further public research funding, prompted Dr Venter to leave the NIH in 1992 and set up a private research institute, The Institute for Genomic Research.And, in 1995, he again stunned the scientific establishment by unveiling the first, complete genome of a free-living organism, Haemophilus influenzae, a major cause of childhood ear infections and meningitis.His greatest challenge to the establishment came in May 1998, when he announced the formation of a commercial company, Celera Genomics, to crack the entire human genetic code in just three years. At that point, the public project was three years into a 10-year programme.Both efforts published their results in 2001. What some saw as Dr Venter's disregard for scientific conventions such as open access to data brought him opprobrium in some circles.Nevertheless, the financial rewards were enough to leave him in a highly unusual position for a scientist - with enough money and resources to do the science he wanted without having to tap the usual bureaucratic sources for funding and infrastructure.In 2006, he formed the J Craig Venter Institute which would spearhead the labour to create the world's first synthetic life form. Dr Venter kept the scientific journals and the media abreast of developments, trumpeting several key advances as he edged closer to his goal.But he has pursued other projects in the meantime. Dr Venter has roamed the oceans in his yacht, Sorcerer II, collecting life forms in an unprecedented genetic treasure hunt.The project aims to sequence genomes from the vast range of microbes living in the sea, to provide scientists with a better understanding of the evolution and function of genes and proteins.The synthetic life breakthrough, when it was announced, was not without controversy. But Dr Venter will have come to expect that.I think they're going to potentially create a new industrial revolution, he said of the synthetic microbes.If we can really get cells to do the production that we want, they could help wean us off oil and reverse some of the damage to the environment by capturing carbon dioxide.", "reference": "``maverick\\'\\'is a word that seems to follow craig venter around.", "sentences": ["jk venter is one of the world\\'s most successful scientists."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "OtherE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\n  \"sentence\": \"jk venter is one of the world's most successful scientists.\",\n  \"reason\": \"The transcript discusses J.

James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.'

It's a moral position taken by Pope Francis, actor George Clooney and even by the Kardashians. On the 2008 campaign trail, Obama promised to use the word genocide to describe the 1915 massacre by Turks of Armenians -- a pledge he made when seeking Armenian-American votes. Back then, he held up his willingness to call it a genocide as an example of why he was the kind of truth-telling candidate the nation needed. 8 things to know about the mass killings of Armenians 100 years ago In 2006, after the U.S. Ambassador to Armenia was asked to resign for using the term Armenian genocide, then-Sen. Obama hammered the Bush administration for not taking a stand. The Armenian genocide is not an allegation, a personal opinion, or a point of view, but rather a widely documented fact supported by an overwhelming body of historical evidence, he said. But that was then. And now, as was the case with Bush, Obama regards Turkey -- the only Muslim majority country in NATO -- as a more crucial ally than Armenia. Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO, behind only the U.S., and is a crucial ally when it comes to Syria, ISIS, Iran and other Middle East issues. And Turkey denies this history. We cannot define what happened in 1915 as a genocide, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told CNN on Tuesday. Why Turkey won't say the G-word when it comes to the Armenians In her Pulitzer Prize-winning book about genocide, Obama's current Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power hammered U.S. policy makers for not acknowledging or acting to stop such atrocities. No U.S. president has ever made genocide prevention a priority, and no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to its occurrence.

Joshua Quincy Burns, formerly of Brighton, was sentenced to three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse earlier this month. Joshua Burns and and his wife, Brenda Burns, say he is innocent, and that he grabbed their daughter Naomi's face when she slipped from his lap as he ended a phone call with his wife in March 2014.\u00a0He claims he was trying to save her from hitting her head on a coffee table in their home. His now-one-year-old daughter suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages. But the couple call\u00a0it 'an accident', not child abuse. Scroll down for video Joshua Burns (right) was sentenced to\u00a0three years' probation with the first served in Livingston County Jail for second-degree child abuse after his daughter Naomi (in his arms) suffered several injuries. He and his wife Brenda Burns (left) maintain Joshua Burns's innocence Brenda Burns has refused to allow social workers and Michigan's Department of Human Services to see Naomi, according to the Livingston Daily. She was not charged criminally in the case, and a civil jury - when the state was seeking to end parental rights - found Brenda Burns not accountable for Naomi's injuries. The couple started a website called TornFamily\u00a0in hopes of raising awareness of their situation and reunite their family. They will also be sharing their story on an episode of Dr Phil on Monday, and Joshua Burns maintains his innocence throughout the episode. 'I never abused my daughter,' he claims in the preview for the show. Joshua Burns claims he never abused little Naomi, and she suffered injuries after she slipped off his lap while he was ending a phone call with his wife and in an attempt to save his daughter from hitting her head on a coffee table he grabbed her by the face Brenda Burns (right) has fled from Michigan to Colorado with Naomi in an attempt to escape being watched by DHS. Their oversight has been put on hold until a June hearing where Joshua Burns's parental rights will be determined After the incident, baby Naomi suffered several injuries, including seizures, hypothermia, hypotension, bradycardia, apnea and retinal hemorrhages 'Then why are you in jail?' Dr Phil asks in return. Brenda Burns claims that a Child Protective Services worker and five police officers entered their home and searched her house when the incident occurred. 'I literally thought: Do you have the right family?' she said to Dr Phil. Brenda Burns's attorney Elizabeth Warner said that the mother has the right to not be monitored by the government, and 'certainly not by the agency that takes children' because she was not held responsible for the injuries and is seen as 'the fit parent' Earlier this month, Judge Miriam Cavanaugh said the DHS's supervision of Naomi would continue but is on hold pending the decision as to whether or not Joshua Burns will continue to have parental rights, according to the Free Press. Joshua Burns continues to claim he's innocent. In an episode of Dr Phil airing Monday, he says, 'I never abused my daughter' Even though her husband has been jailed, Brenda Burns supports her husband and agrees that the incident was 'an accident', not child abuse Brenda Burns fled to Colorado to avoid being watched DHS, which she believes is unconstitutional. Naomi's court-appointed attorney has reportedly seen the child and says told the Livingston County\u00a0Circuit Court that the baby is doing well. Warner, Brenda Burns's attorney, said that Naomi is 'doing very well' and that 'she's pretty advanced for her age'. She said: 'You can see pictures of a sick child with tubes in them and think she's going to be brain damaged forever. 'In fact, if this was a misdiagnosis as we think it was, I think the fact Naomi is so well really supports the parents' position this wasn't abuse. It was a misdiagnoses by a doctor.

'They also may have implications for our ability to successfully assimilate and integrate immigrants,' he added. 'Yet there has been almost no national debate about bringing in so many people legally each year, which is the primary factor driving these numbers.' Currently there are approximately 12million undocumented immigrants in the United States and 70,000 more are expected to cross the border this year, according to the Washington Examiner. There are also more than 4.4million people on a U.S. State Department green card waiting list. And within years, Immigration population will grow almost four times faster than native-born population. From a starting point of 2010, immigration population will reach 15.8 per cent (57million) of the nation's population by 2030, 17.1 (65million) per cent by 2040 and 18.8 per cent (78million) \u00a0by 2060. Immigrants and their descendants will account for 75.5 per cent of the nation's population growth between 2010 and 2050 and 82 per cent of growth between 2010 and 2060. By 2060, immigrants and their descendants will account for 82 per cent of the nation's population growth since 2010 President Barack Obama is trying to use executive powers to expand immigration policies, which\u00a0could potentially exempt about 5million undocumented immigrants from deportation Alabama Rep. Sen. Jeff Sessions, who has been a leader in the immigration debate, said in a letter to the New York Times on Saturday that an increase of immigrants in the country will hurt the middle class. He wrote: 'It defies reason to argue that the record admission of new foreign workers has no negative effect on the wages of American workers, including the wages of past immigrants hoping to climb into the middle class. 'Why would many of the largest business groups in the United States spend millions lobbying for the admission of more foreign workers if such policies did not cut labor costs?' Key business leaders form a group association with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are meeting on Friday to discuss expanding immigration. The meeting it titled 'Understanding and Improving the High-Skilled H-1B Visa Program', according to the examiner.

It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S., Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up. At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees. Southwest doesn't charge any fees, while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags, booking by phone, changing plans and more.", "reference": "southwest airlines tops consumer reports ' survey , with the most seats available . jetblue is at the bottom of the list but ranks high in customer satisfaction .", "sentences": ["a new consumer report finds 70 million passenger trips over the past two years .", "the top performer was southwest airlines , which offered the most award tickets .", "the airline says customers will be able to easily redeem them ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "NoE", "RelE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a new consumer report finds 70 million passenger trips over the past two years .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states there was a \\\"Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years,\\\" which matches the fact conveyed.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the top performer was southwest airlines , which offered the most award tickets .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This reproduces the transcript\u2019s statement that Southwest Airlines was the top performer and offered the most award tickets (11.9 million).\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the airline says customers will be able to easily redeem them .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The only direct claim in the transcript about future redemption is JetBlue saying miles will \\\"eventually\\\" (not necessarily easily) be redeemable; replacing \\\"eventually\\\" with \\\"easily\\\" alters the predicate meaning.\",\n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "predicate error"]}

Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma is a relatively rare and aggressive form of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. It affects  lymphocytes - a type of white blood cell - which are found in the blood and in lymph glands. Lymphoma is a disease where lymphocyte B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way. Patients with the cancer experience a swelling in the lymph nodes. If Burkitts lymphoma is in the chest or throat, people can have difficulty swallowing or breathing, whereas if it appears as a lump in the abdomen, it can cause pain, swelling, nausea and diarrhoea.

This triggered a series of adverse events, including the introduction - and subsequent withdrawal - of a constitution enshrining indigenous Fijian political supremacy.A further coup in 2000, led by businessman George Speight, saw the country's first ethnic Indian prime minister, his cabinet and several MPs held hostage for several weeks.These events caused great harm to the economy - the tourism industry in particular - and Fiji's international reputation.Rancour over the 2000 coup persisted, with bitter divisions over plans to grant an amnesty to those behind it. The continuing tensions generated by these disputes culminated in a bloodless military takeover in 2006 - Fiji's fourth coup in 20 years.In September 2009, Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth over its lack of progress towards democracy. It was only the second full suspension in the organisation's history.In 2012 the government agreed to hold free elections in 2014, prompting Fiji's powerful neighbours Australia and New Zealand to restore full diplomatic ties. Following the elections the Commonwealth re-instated Fiji as a member.Fiji's population, which resides mostly on the two main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, is divided between indigenous Fijians and Indo-Fijians, the descendents of indentured labourers brought from India.The two groups were of roughly equal numbers until the mid-2000s, by which time coups and agitation had prompted thousands of Indo-Fijians to flee. Indigenous Fijians now make up small overall majority.Mixing between the two groups is minimal, and informal segregation runs deep at almost every level of society.There are also very small non-Indo-Fijian, non-Fijian minority communities, such as Chinese and Rotumans.Although the former British colony relies heavily on the sugar and tourism industries for its foreign exchange, its economy is diverse. Gold, silver and limestone are mined, and there is a strong services sector and some light manufacturing.Nonetheless, Fiji has been hampered by persistent trade and budget deficits, making it one of the world's largest per capita recipients of aid.", "reference": "the 800-plus volcanic and coral islands that make up the pacific nation of fiji enjoy a tropical climate and host a significant tourism industry.", "sentences": ["in our series of letters from african journalists, novelist and writer adaobi tricia nwaubani looks at the recent political events in fiji."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"in our series of letters from african journalists, novelist and writer adaobi tricia nwaubani looks at the recent political events in fiji.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript never mentions a series by African journalists nor Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani; these details are introduced solely in the summary and are unsupported by the source.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

The barbaric footage, released earlier today, shows the men kneeling in the middle of a dusty road in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, as a militant brandishing a sharpened sword stands behind them. It comes just one day after the extremist group claim to have shot and beheaded more than 30 Ethiopian Christians in Libya. Each of the men are forced on to their hands and knees in the war-torn street before they are beheaded The harrowing video shows the sword used to kill the men being forged and sharpened for the executions The three men were accused of being Assad agents, working for the Syrian governmment, say ISIS The new eight-minute video shows the men - wearing orange Guantanamo-style jumpsuits with their hands and feet in chains - sitting in a dirty, underground room. After giving information about each of the prisoners in Arabic, the men are blindfolded and filmed in the back of a moving van while an ISIS militant decked in black guards over them. When the van stops, the barefoot captives are escorted out and begin to march slowly down an abandoned street, surrounded by fighters holding guns. The professionally-shot film pans the scene - showing buildings irreparably damaged by bombing - before phasing into a picture of the executioner's sword being sharpened before the brutal executions. One by one the prisoners are beheaded by a fighter, who is dressed completely in black and unidentifiable. Their bodies are left on the road. Initial reports suggested the extremist group targeted the men because they worked for the Syrian regime. But they did not confirm who the men - thought to be aged between 35 and 45 - were or when the execution took place. The prisoners were filmed barefoot and in shackles in an unknown prison at the start of the sick video They were then blindfolded and transported in a van to the execution point - thought to be\u00a0Deir ez-Zo in Syria Sparks fly from the sword as it is sharpened, before being used to behead the men in a brutal execution One by one the men are murdered. The body of one of the men can been seen after he was beheaded It is the latest footage released by the militant group, which is increasingly using propaganda to encourage would-be jihadi fighters. Yesterday a 29-minute video, titled 'Until It Came To Them - Clear Evidence', showed dozens of militants holding two separate groups captive in Libya. It showed at least 16 men, described by Islamic State as the 'followers of the cross from the enemy Ethiopian Church', being shot in a desert area while 12 others were beheaded on a beach. In February a similar video was released showing the beheading of a group of 21 Coptic Christians on a beach in Libya. The helpless men were kept under a close watch by their ISIS captives. Videos of this nature - often professionally shot - are used by the militant group as propaganda to attract other would-be jihadi fighters The bodies of each of the helpless men, thought to be aged between 35 and 45, were then left on the road One of the victims, flanked by two fighters in black, can be seen being led down the abandoned Syrian road ISIS has taken over large sections of iraq and ISIS and carried out multiple public executions similar to this The battle against Islamic State amid a protracted civil war in Syria is thought to have already claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. ISIS has destroyed churches and Christian shrines in the country. They also demanded that Christians living under its rule pay a 'special tax' known as jizya. Fighters from the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) have been on the offensive and a large area is now divided between Kurdish and IS control.

You have got to do something'.And I thought she was over-reacting so I just said 'don't be silly'.And so of course as soon as I saw the police I knew that's that what it was.And I felt such a sense of guilt for having first of all told Alice not to worry and secondly told Emma not to be silly when actually if I hadn't said that Alice might still be alive.Prof Ruggles said he didn't think any of them, including his daughter, realised how serious the situation was despite the signs.Her parents have set up the Alice Ruggles Trust and they said they were hoping to use that and their daughter's vibrant personality to make other people aware of the dangers of stalking.They said they wanted her to be remembered for that and as smiling and laughing and making some sort of cheeky comment.Dhillon, 26, denied murder but was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum of 22 years.", "reference": "the parents of a woman murdered by her ex-boyfriend have said they knew immediately he was responsible.", "sentences": ["the parents of a woman who murdered her sick baby have said they have been ``overwhelmed\\'\\'by her parents."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\n  \"sentence\": \"the parents of a woman who murdered her sick baby have said they have been ``overwhelmed''by her parents.\",\n  \"reason\": \"The transcript is about the parents of murder victim Alice Ruggles discussing her killing by Trimaan Dhillon; it says nothing about a woman who murdered her sick baby or anyone being \\\"overwhelmed,\\\" so the entities and core facts are wrong.\",\n  \"category\": \"entity error\"\n}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

He trains Shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy, the record-breaking Jump jockey who is about to gain his 20th consecutive jockeys' championship and retire. McCoy has not decided yet whether he is riding Shutthefrontdoor in the \u00a31million Crabbie's Grand National at Aintree on  April 11, but everything points to him doing so. Jonjo O'Neill hopes jockey AP McCoy rides\u00a0Shutthefrontdoor to Grand National success later this month O'Neill told Betfred: 'Shutthefrontdoor is in great form. I could not be happier with him. I would have liked to have got a run into him (before the Grand National) but he had an abscess on his sinus in January/February time which took a while to find out where it was. 'We did think about giving him at run at Cheltenham (at the Festival in March) but decided not to. I think he is a better horse on a flat track and secondly I did not want to give him a hard race at a time when he wasn't as well as he is now. He is schooling well and is spot on. 'He is a clean-winded horse, who is not hard to get ready. He was ready to run and win first time out at Carlisle. He is going to Aintree fresh and well. It is all down to AP now if he is going ride him. 'You need to have a good classy horse for the National. Before, you needed a good jumper and a lot of luck, now it is a proper race. Aintree has done a great job with the track and the fences are first class. 'He likes to be up there and hopefully in the first half of the runners - that at least is my plan. If he got luck in running over the first mile, I would ride him myself. 'I don't bet so it does not make any difference to me what price he is - I am just training the horse as though he was going for a little race at Stratford or whatever! This year's Grand National will be McCoy's last-ever at Aintree before his retirement at the end of the season 'Hopefully, AP is going to ride Shutthefrontdoor and the public will want to back him, looking for a fairytale story. We would all love that to happen, but it is a tall order. 'The only pressure (on me) is that Shutthefrontdoor gets there safe and sound. He is in the best form I can possibly get him. I would be more nervous if we had hiccups now but we had them in January and February. If he doesn't win, we can blame whoever rides him! 'I'd love good ground at Aintree - he is a well-balanced horse and a great mover. He does not want it too soft. Perfect jumping ground is ideal. They make a good job of the ground at Aintree - we just don't want the heavens to open. He is as good as any horse in the National. 'We are going there full of confidence, but you have got to be realistic - it is the National.' Don't Push It gave O'Neill, McManus and McCoy their first Grand National victory in 2010. O'Neill continued: 'This preparation has gone better than Don't Push It's. Don't Push It was a bit of a law unto himself. Alan Berry has done all the work with this horse, like he did with Don't Push It. We think we have got it all right and are very happy with the way things have gone. Shutthefrontdoor, pictured with O'Neill (right) is the favourite for the race on April 11 'Shutthefrontdoor is a lovely horse - a real old pet - and loves racing, while the other horse was half-mad, a character. 'He lacks experience as a jumper but I think he is quite clever, pretty accurate and knows what he is doing. If he does take to the fences, he will run a blinder. 'I have taken him away (to racecourses) a couple of times so he is not too fresh. I don't want him to be too fresh over the first couple of fences. I used to build three or four National fences every year but one year we didn't and that was the year Don't Push It won so we haven't since. The Grand National fences are now really inviting. 'The Grand National grips you and is magic to be involved in. 'We will miss AP not riding in races next season but hopefully he is still going to be involved. We are not going to let him off the hook that easily - we may drag him in for schooling.' O'Neill envisages a team of between eight and 12 running at Aintree during the three days of the Crabbie's Grand National Festival (April 9 - 11). 'Holywell will run in the Betfred Bowl (April 9) after a great run (fourth) in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was beaten fair and square - the ground went against us a bit. He put a lot of effort into his jumping and did not quite get home. 'He came out of the race a bit tired for the first week to 10 days but is absolutely flying now and did a lovely bit of work yesterday [Wednesday] morning. He came alive there last year and seems to like the track.'", "reference": "crabbie 's grand national takes place at aintree on april 11 . shutthefrontdoor , trained by jonjo o'neill , is the race favourite . ap mccoy is expected to ride shutthefrontdoor at aintree .", "sentences": ["jonjo o'neill hosted a media stable visit on thursday at his jackdaws castle yard in gloucestershire .", "he trains shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron j p mcmanus , who owns jackdaws castle and retains ap mccoy , the record-breaking jump jockey .", "mccoy has not decided yet whether he is riding shutthefrontdoor in the # 1million crabbie 's grand national at aintree on april 11 .", "o'neill said : ` shutthefrontdoor is in great form .", "i could not be happier with him .", "i would have liked to have got a run into him", "but he had an abscess on his sinus in january ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "OtherE", "NoE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "CorefE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "CorefE", "CorefE", "CorefE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"jonjo o'neill hosted a media stable visit on thursday at his jackdaws castle yard in gloucestershire .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that Jonjo O'Neill hosted such a visit at Jackdaws Castle on Thursday.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"he trains shutthefrontdoor for his principal patron j p mcmanus , who owns jackdaws castle and retains ap mccoy , the record-breaking jump jockey .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms that O'Neill trains Shutthefrontdoor for J P McManus, who owns Jackdaws Castle and retains AP McCoy.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"mccoy has not decided yet whether he is riding shutthefrontdoor in the # 1million crabbie 's grand national at aintree on april 11 .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says McCoy has not yet decided whether to ride Shutthefrontdoor in the \u00a31 million Grand National on 11 April.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"o'neill said : ` shutthefrontdoor is in great form .\",\n    \"reason\": \"O'Neill is quoted in the transcript saying exactly that Shutthefrontdoor is in great form.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"i could not be happier with him .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Immediately after remarking on the horse\u2019s great form, O'Neill says he could not be happier with him.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"i would have liked to have got a run into him\",\n    \"reason\": \"O'Neill states he would have liked to get a run into Shutthefrontdoor before the National.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but he had an abscess on his sinus in january .\",\n    \"reason\": \"O'Neill explains the horse had an abscess on his sinus in January/February; summarizing as January alone does not contradict the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

One third of the \u00a318bn cost is being provided by Chinese investors.Hours after EDF's board voted to approve the \u00a318bn power plant on Thursday, the government launched a further review of the project.This stunning new development came all the way from the top of government and the timing seemed calculated to cause maximum impact.EDF executives were taken completely off guard, the post-Brexit run of major investment is abruptly halted and what precious entente cordiale in Anglo-French relations there is left after the EU referendum result seems diminished.Is it a genuine pause for a new government to read the small print of a project that is two administrations old, or a signal of a potential change in policy?Simon Jack: Hinkley delay is a high stakes betTom Greatrex, the chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, urged the government to make a decision as soon as possible.We need to get on and do this and that's why I'm hoping the government make their decision very soon because if it goes on for a lengthy period of time we are going to run the risk of having real problems in terms of our energy supplies, he said.Then what happens is that we end up paying a lot more and we end up paying for much more dirty power which we can't afford to do if we are to meet our climate commitments.Claire Jacobson, head of climate, energy and environment policy at the EEF manufacturers' organisation said the government's decision was yet another blow to a decision that has been hindered by many delays and uncertainties.Hinkley Point C is expected to provide 7% of the UK's total electricity requirement.Announcing the approval of investment on Thursday, EDF had described the plant as a unique asset for French and British industries, saying it would benefit the nuclear sectors in both countries and would give a boost to employment.However, the project has been hit in recent months by concerns about EDF's financial capacity.Despite the Chinese investment, Hinkley Point would remain an enormous undertaking for the stressed French company, which has had to raise money from its owners.Earlier this week, EDF shareholders approved plans to issue new shares to raise \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.4bn) to help pay for the project.Ahead of Thursday's vote on whether to approve the project, an EDF board member, Gerard Magnin, resigned, saying the project was very risky financially.Earlier this year, EDF's finance director, Thomas Piquemal, had resigned amid reports he thought Hinkley could damage EDF itself.5,600workers on site at peak4,000km electrical cabling230,000 tonnes of steel5.6m cubic metres of earth to be movedEnvironmentalists are also concerned about the plan. Greenpeace executive director John Sauven said: Countless experts have warned that for British families this power station will be terrible value for money.He added that EDF's decision to go ahead with the investment, doesn't prove the UK is open for business post-Brexit - it just shows the Hinkley deal became too big to fail in the eyes of British and French politicians.The campaign group added that more investment was needed for renewable energy such as offshore wind.Jan 2006 - Government proposes nuclear as part of future energy mixMar 2013 - Construction of Hinkley Point approvedOct 2013 - UK government agrees \u00a392.50 per megawatt-hour will be paid for electricity produced at the Somerset site - around double the current market rate at the timeOct 2015 - EDF signs investment agreement with China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN)July 2016 - EDF board approves final investment decision, but the UK Government postpones a final decision on the project until autumn.", "reference": "plans to build the first new uk nuclear plant in 20 years have suffered an unexpected delay after the government postponed a final decision until the early autumn.", "sentences": ["the government has given the go-ahead for a new nuclear power plant at a former nuclear plant in somerset."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the government has given the go-ahead for a new nuclear power plant at a former nuclear plant in somerset.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says the UK government has delayed and is reconsidering approval for Hinkley Point C, not that it has already given the go-ahead.\",\n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

They said: 'We'd like you to work with this dialogue coach.'He said: 'You think we're all born the same?' I said: 'Of course we are.' He said: 'Some people are lucky, they're born 6ft 4ins and some people are born 3ft 2ins. Some people have got straight even features and some are not so pleasant on the eye.'I said: 'That's the luck of the draw, isn't it?'. He said: 'Yes, but the big sin is if you don't use what you've got'. He said: 'You're 6ft 1ins and you only stand 5ft 9ins, so if you believe we're all born the same way then why don't you stand your full height?He said did you go to university? I said: 'No'. He said: 'Do you regret that?' I said: 'Yes, I do a great deal'.He said: Do you feel that sometimes when you're talking with people that you might mispronounce a word or you don't have the right word for the explanation?' I said: 'Yes'.He said: 'Well, there you are. That's you're problem'.And it made such a difference to my life. Joe was on the set everyday. He made a lot of difference to me, gave me a great deal of confidence, otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk to you.There will also be a showing at the Elan Valley Visitor Centre, near Rhayader, on 6 July.It's great that so many people have become involved in this project and I can't wait to see the effect their brilliant stories have on an audience, added Tally Evans.There's a huge range of stories, about 100 in total, ranging from a printing press falling down a lift shaft to a eulogy for a dead friend.Sir Roger, who is not shown on screen but has a speaking part in Turning Points, is joined by Welsh athlete Jamie Baulch, an Olympic silver medallist in 1996.Others taking part are artist Ellen Jackman, who lives in Birmingham, visually impaired dancer Lyn Street, from Newport, Daniel Chapman, an 11-year-old from near Rhayader who has autism, and the filmmaker himself, who is partially sighted.Tally Evans said the stories were woven together to speak with one voice, while 11-year-old Morgan Evans, from Rhayader, runs through a Welsh landscape.Vibrant images, sometimes lyrical, sometimes satirical, add depth and colour to the stories as they reach an inspiring conclusion.There are other stories on the Turning Points website from Paralympic gold medallists Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson and David Roberts, world champion hurdler Dai Greene, former Commonwealth and European welterweight boxing champion Colin Jones and Olympic cycling gold medallist Geraint Thomas.In the film Tally Evans explains how he came to terms with an hereditary eye problem, which left him partially sighted.A social worker told him his life was going to be different, and if he did not come to terms with it he would be a very unhappy man.I refused rehab, where I was supposed to go off to another city to be taught how to be a proper, grateful disabled person, threw the Braille card in the bin and have lived exactly the sort of life I always wanted, Tally Evans said.I never saw my social worker again.The film also has contributions from the former First Minister Rhodri Morgan and ex-Formula 1 world champion Jackie Stewart.Nick Capaldi, Arts Council of Wales chief executive, said: Chris Tally Evans brings his own unique insight to a series of personal tales, set against the inspiring Welsh landscape.", "reference": "former james bond star sir roger moore has revealed how he was helped to reach the top in hollywood, in a new 10-minute film celebrating the olympics.", "sentences": ["the festival of the world\\'s biggest film festival has opened in london, with the aim of turning points for the first time."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the festival of the world's biggest film festival has opened in london, with the aim of turning points for the first time.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript never describes a 'world's biggest film festival,' never states that it has just opened in London, and never frames the purpose as 'turning points for the first time'; these ideas are absent or contradict the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

One traveller in particular knows how wrong a holiday snap can go, after he posted a picture online of him 'missing' the top of the Eiffel Tower and asked users to help improve his photo. On a recent trip to Paris, Belgian food blogger Yves Van De Ven enjoyed poking fun at those tourist clich\u00e9s and took a couple of pictures deliberately missing some of the more famous monuments. Little did he know he would become an internet sensation, after his photo with the Eiffel Tower captioned 'nailed it' was uploaded to photosharing website 4chan. Since then over 100 photoshopped pictures have sprung up comically connecting his finger with the tip of the famous attraction, and it didn't stop there... Nailed it!\u00a0Yves Van De Ven, 37, uploaded this photograph on social media in a bid to poke fun of the typical tourist pictures Going viral! An upload on photo-sharing site 4chan requested users connect his finger with the top of the tower, as many tourist pictures aim to achieve The 37-year-old said he thought it would be hilarious to deliberately make fun of the typical pictures with famous landmarks. 'The original pictures in which me and my friends 'nailed it' were an instant hit with my friends as soon as I posted them on Facebook,' Van De Ven said. 'There were people that thought we just took poor pictures but luckily most of my friends know better.' Obviously the internet had something to say about the pictures and after someone uploaded the pictures to 4chan, users from all over the globe submitted their own 'improved' versions of Van De Ven's pictures. Created images ranged from the comical, with the 301m tower bent over to touch his outstretched finger, to the absurd, with Van De Ven imposed into Michaelango's Creation of Adam, reaching out towards the Eiffel Tower. The wondrous offerings demonstrate what a brilliant place the internet is, and how no one's holiday pictures are safe. Bendy tower! The tower appears to have flopped over in the summer heat, making a connection with the food blogger's finger Cut out! Despite covering the 37-year-old, his finger is clearly in contact in this picture! Expert photoshopping creates a miniature tower touching his finger, never mind about the gaping white hole left behind! Close enough! Tilting the tower 45 degrees, and extending his arm in an octopus fashion were methods used to 'improve' the picture Super hero! In a Hulk-like fashion, not only has\u00a0Van De Ven knocked over the Eiffel Tower, but also has it grasped in two fingers Van De Ven is shocked but highly entertained at the widespread response to his holiday pictures. 'I can honestly say that we have had as much fun taking these silly pictures as we have had the week after overviewing the hilarious aftermath. 'Some of the photoshopped pictures are just brilliant.' Eiffel Tower touches\u00a0Van De Ven! This photo plays on role reversal with the tower spectacularly missing touching him Basically there! A longer arm is all it takes to recreate the popular tourist pose If in doubt, enlarge the poser (left), or do as most people do and stand closer to the camera! Or why not create more failed fingers (right) to add to the picture? Why not just duplicate the offending failed finger all over the Eiffel Tower? (Still without it making contact!) See double! That works! Not only does he touch the top, he does it twice in this picture A portal has allowed the tip of the tower to protrude near the blogger's feet so he can touch the tip Why not ignore the failed hand all together, and just reposition it on top? Job done! (left) Or why not reverse the original photograph? (right) So elegant!

Everyone's invited to log on and chat while a recorded sermon is streamed.So far, people from 61 different countries have logged on, according to online pastor Darren Parker.There are lots of reasons why people can't get to church on a Sunday so we thought we would bring the church to them, he says.The chat room is like the foyer of a church.Virtual prayer requests received from the global congregation have included:Its first Christmas theme is Star Wars, the subject of three festive sermons.We found some real truths [in the franchise] which compare to Christmas, says Mr Parker.The new Star Wars is called The Force Awakens. Our sermons are called The Hope Awakens - it's about awakening hope for humanity.The Star Wars sermon will be running throughout the day on the church's website.Guardians of Ancora is a recently launched, free-to-play fantasy game available on Android, iPhone and Kindle platforms. It's developed by the same people behind the young people's group the Scripture Union.The game is aimed at eight to 11-year-olds and director Terry Clutterham says 45,000 were playing within four months of its release.Ancora is a weird, wonderful, amazing place but it is a fictional space where children enter as guardians, he says.The problem with Ancora is that the light has been stolen from that world, so there is darkness around.It's the role of the guardians to rediscover the lost treasured stories which are the stories of the Bible... and those stories help to light up the world.You get the idea.Special content created for Christmas includes two new Bible-themed quests in which players find the birth of the baby Jesus.There are lots of very charming nativity videos out there but it's not easy to rack up the hits.German marketing company Viral.de had huge success with its 2010 video The Digital Story of Nativity, which has so far been viewed almost six million times.There are no actors, no animals, and not even a stable.The whole story is told in the form of Facebook status updates, tweets, Google searches and Foursquare check-ins.Highlights include one Joseph Carpenter buying a cow and a donkey on Farmville before uploading a baby picture, which looks suspiciously like a Christmas card.The Churches Advertising Network also had a respectable go - Christmas Starts with a Baby's Giggle, which features a modern-day couple sitting in a trendy living room with their baby, only for the scenery behind them to keep changing eras until they are Mary and Joseph in the stable. So far, it has been viewed about 250,000 times.It's pretty good - we're not John Lewis, we're a group of Christians with a very small budget, explains Frances Goodwin, who chairs the network.The message is that Christmas is the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.However, according to a report in the Daily Mail, the charity's attempt to get the ad screened at cinemas was thwarted when the organisation that sells screen rejected it for being too religious.After distributing more than three million printed books and nearly five million booklets telling Old Testament stories in the genre of Japanese cult cartoon form Manga, the company Next Manga has just launched its work in app and e-book form - so far, only in the English language.The book containing its version of the nativity is called the Manga Messiah.It is available in 33 different languages - 25,000 copies of the Arabic version were recently sent to Syrian and Libyan refugees.We see it as a unique opportunity to share a message of hope and peace with these people who have suffered so much, says founder Roald Lidal.One third of all publications are in Manga form in Japan, adds Mr Lidal, who lived in the country for 45 years.There is a Manga for every age and every type of person. It seemed very difficult to proclaim the message of the Bible without using Manga.As if you needed the excuse. But lots of groups are using platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to connect with their communities, especially at this time of year.I don't see that much these days of trying to share the Gospel in 140 characters, says Kevin Bennett of Christian media group Premier.The Church is mostly trying to just drop thoughts in, get people to fix their gaze on something a little bit higher for a second and maybe consider things that are a bit more spiritual rather than earthly.Jesus would definitely be on Twitter, adds Jules Middleton, blogger and mission pastor at The Point Church in Burgess Hill, West Sussex.He was a great communicator.Sounds like a seal of approval to me.", "reference": "nothing says christmas more than watching that harry potter movie you\\'ve already seen 2,900 times, eating a mountain of lukewarm turkey and trying to work out where you\\'re going to put all those new socks.", "sentences": ["'s a lot of talk in the church of england and the church of england\\'s christmas sermon."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"'s a lot of talk in the church of england and the church of england's christmas sermon.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript never mentions the Church of England or its Christmas sermon, so the sentence introduces information that is not present.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

It was like living in a different world, not like living on earth.They used a blade to cut the letters RUF into my chest, so if I was thinking about escaping I knew that I could be killed if I got caught by militia who supported the government.The rebels also threatened to cut off my legs or arms if I tried to flee, and I saw this happen to other people.Sometimes they would even take out the heart from someone's chest and cook it up with onions and ask people to eat it.It seems like a nightmare now.I remember when we used to look for food and demanded that people hand it over.If they said: We don't have food, we told them they were lying, and then we beat them even if they could have been telling the truth.Sometimes we were forced to kill, which we did under the influence of drugs: Marijuana was very easy to take - we used it like people drink coffee - and cocaine was also available.I was given the impression that if you took these drugs then you would be brave and if you were brave you would have the opportunity in the jungle to climb up the ranks.Luckily I did manage to escape from the jungle without being killed and I went to the capital, Freetown, but was unable to find my relatives.I lived alone, but teamed up with some guys doing things like pick-pocketing and I was caught.Fortunately [while in jail] I met a preacher called Richard Cole, who was the founder of a project called Lifeline Nehemiah which aimed to give hope, and a home, to people like me who felt they had lost hope.He encouraged me saying: You used to cause atrocities, but you can be used to contribute to rebuild the nation.At the home he encouraged me to continue with my schooling, he also told me that guys like me would be leaders of the nation and help to rebuild it.Richard taught me that it was God who was taking me through all these troubling times, and I also learnt that it was important to give back what was invested in me.He passed away in 2006 but we had that vision and continue with it.When the Ebola crisis came to Sierra Leone in 2014 we considered it to be a common enemy.We were not medical practitioners but we had the passion to change things and we decided to develop our clinic to bring in suspected Ebola cases.Through this so many lives were saved.There were three key activities.We started with education as people found it difficult to accept that Ebola was real. So we started visiting communities and explaining that it was real and it was a death sentence.We educated more than 10,000 people, and explained the message in their languages - Temne, Krio and Limba.Secondly we started supporting people by giving them food and other items. This became a massive operation - visiting 11,000 people - and started giving fresh food in urban and rural areas.Thirdly we were able to team up with other agencies and put up an Ebola treatment unit that saved so many lives.People were frightened.Sometimes when we visited people refused to accept us but as we kept coming back we became familiar to them.It was scary and some people said it was witchcraft, but we persuaded them that there were principles to observe to protect themselves.One of the worst incidents I witnessed was when I saw a pregnant woman with suspected Ebola lying in front of us.There were three others in the house who were also suspected cases and no-one could come to their house because it was too dangerous.When I saw that woman lying there I felt very bad, I came out and talked with other volunteers and after that we started to set up an Ebola treatment clinic.We didn't have any funds but we had a lot of help from local chiefs and the community, and that was how it started.Now I see my life as a changed person.I regret all that I did, but I am confident now that the future is great.We are investing in young people; I believe young people have a role in changing the world, not only Sierra Leone but the world.If we invest in them then we are building the future.11,314Deaths - probable, confirmed and suspected(Includes one in the US and six in Mali)4,808 Liberia3,955 Sierra Leone2,536 Guinea8 Nigeria", "reference": "prince tommy williams, who used to be a child soldier in sierra leone, was one of hundreds of volunteers who helped fight the spread of ebola.", "sentences": ["richard hamilton has revealed how he used drugs to help those affected by the deadly jungle of northern ireland."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "LinkE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\n  \"sentence\": \"richard hamilton has revealed how he used drugs to help those affected by the deadly jungle of northern ireland.\",\n  \"reason\": \"In the transcript Richard Hamilton is merely the BBC interviewer; it is the former child soldier who recounts having taken drugs in Sierra Leone, and there is no mention of helping people with drugs nor any connection to Northern Ireland.\",\n  \"category\": \"entity error\"\n}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

The huge rise will be due to a baby boom among Pakistani, Bangladeshi, and African immigrants who usually come to this country during their young, child bearing years. Campaigners fear that this sudden increase will put pressure on housing, schools and the NHS, and worsen the quality of life in Britain as a whole. A baby boom among ethnic minorities in the UK will see numbers rocket by the middle of the century, according to new data, with a quarter of Britons coming from a minority background by 2051 The research, carried out by Leeds University and reported in The Times, shows that overall, between 2011 and 2051, the UK's population will rise from 63.4 million to 77.4 million. While the number of white Britons will increase over that time, by almost three million, the minority population will increase more than three times faster, by 10 million. By the midpoint of the 21st century, minority ethnic communities will make up 24.3 per cent of the total population, compared with 12.8 per cent during the 2011 census. In contrast the proportion of whites will drop from 87.2 per cent in 2011 to 75.7 per cent in 2015. The sudden rise in the ethnic minority population marks an increase on predictions from the same university just five years ago. In an almost identical study, published in July 2010, professors at Leeds University predicted that ethnic minorities would make up around a fifth of the total population by 2051. In the same study they also predicted that British society would become much more integrated, with those from ethnic minorities moving into more affluent areas. Professor Philip Rees, who led the project, said: 'The ethnic makeup of UK's population is evolving significantly. 'Groups outside the White British majority are increasing in size and share, not just in the areas of initial migration, but throughout the country and our projections suggest that this trend is set to continue through to 2051. While the white British population will increase between now and 2051, the minority population will increase nearly three times as fast, meaning they will make up a greater share of the population 'At a regional level, ethnic minorities will shift out of deprived inner city areas to more affluent areas, which echoes the way white groups have migrated in the past. 'In particular black and Asian populations in the least deprived local authorities will increase significantly.' The new research is likely to cause anxiety for those pushing for greater control of British borders, including an in-out referendum on the EU, or a renegotiation of the open borders treaty. While the Conservatives pledged at the last election to cut net migration from 'the hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands', it now stands at just under 300,000 per year. While Cameron has promised a renegotiation of EU laws if reelected, followed by a referendum, the Tory manifesto only contains an 'ambition' to cut current migration. While Ed Miliband has admitted that Tony Blair's Labour government made mistakes on immigration, he has also failed to commit to targets, though he has insisted that all new migrants should be able to speak English. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan also announced yesterday that her department is conducting a review into the pressures that migrants put on schools. That echoes the concerns of researchers such as David Coleman, professor of demography at Oxford University, who said: 'Money of the consequences of large-scale migration are damaging. 'We do not need up to 13 million more people by the mid century. Almost all that increase will be immigrants and their children. It will not make the UK a happier or richer place.

Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward\u00a0Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.", "reference": "kevin sinfield made his 500th appearance for leeds . warrington registered tries through gene ormsby , joel monaghan , ashton sims , ben currie and roy asotasi . leeds replied with kallum watkins and mitch achurch .", "sentences": ["kevin UNK beat leeds rhinos in the first half of the super league .", "the rhinos were also drawn with their worst performance of the season .", "leeds had an early chance when prop adam UNK was held up over the line ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE", "CircE", "NoE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CorefE", "OutE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "NoE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"kevin UNK beat leeds rhinos in the first half of the super league .\",\n    \"reason\": \"In the transcript Warrington (not Kevin Sinfield) beat Leeds over the whole match; Kevin Sinfield actually played for Leeds and was on the losing side, so the subject\u2013predicate relationship is wrong.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the rhinos were also drawn with their worst performance of the season .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that Leeds produced their worst performance of the season, so this statement is accurate despite awkward phrasing.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"leeds had an early chance when prop adam UNK was held up over the line .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript reports that Leeds prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line early on, matching this statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "no error", "no error"]}

Sarah Watson, 34, had a brief liaison with the Manchester United defender at a Christmas party for the team. But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs.

The Prime Minister said he will amend the Working Times regulations so for three days people can volunteer or serve as a school governor, and get paid in addition to their 28 days of paid holiday. But business leaders criticised the move as\u00a0heavy-handed government intervention', amid doubts about how the policy would be paid for. Scroll down for video Happy handshake: The Prime Minister met staff and volunteers at the Age UK Day Centre in Plymouth today Prime Minister David Cameron's Big Society good deeds scheme will only affect firms with 250 or more staff The policy will apply to workers at firms with at least 250 staff - an estimated 10 million in the private sector and five million in the public sector. Volunteers would be able to take the time to volunteer in a block or flexibly. Announcing the policy Mr Cameron said: 'This election is about building a better future for our children and grandchildren. The foundation stone of that better future is our economic security. But Conservatives know the society we build on top of that is just as important too. 'This is the clearest demonstration of the Big Society in action - and I'm proud it's a Conservative government that will deliver it.' But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors (IoD), criticised the announcement, saying the policy did not appear to have been thought through. 'Many, many businesses are already highly engaged in their local community and with charitable causes, and the IoD thoroughly supports them. Passing a law to compel firms to pay their staff to volunteer for charity is hardly in keeping with the spirit of philanthropy. 'Businesses should support their staff if they want to volunteer, but the architects of this idea cannot pretend that forcing firms to give an additional three days of paid leave will do anything other than add costs. Time off for charity work and volunteering is a matter for managers and employees to discuss between themselves, not a target for heavy-handed government intervention. 'This announcement not only undermines the Tory record on reducing business regulation, it also puts additional pressure on public sector employers, and ultimately the taxpayer. Frankly, the essence of volunteering is that it is voluntary. The IoD would welcome proposals to incentivise and make it easier for companies to facilitate volunteering, but it has to be a choice.' Mr Cameron's plan will affect around 15 million workers across Great Britain in private and public sectors Survival expert and Television star Bear Grylls said that he supports Mr Cameron's volunteering scheme The plan was praised by the chairman of BT Mike Rake.\u00a0He said: 'Corporate volunteering is a triple win - a win for the community, a win for individuals doing the volunteering, and a win for companies.' Survival expert and TV star Bear Grylls also lent Mr Cameron his support for the scheme.\u00a0'Any initiative that encourages people to volunteer is good news,' he said. 'All of us struggle to find extra time and that's why to have firm government support that enables millions to volunteer is a huge step forward towards building solid communities all around the UK.' However, just hours after Cameron's announcement, Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said companies would not be forced to organise paid time-off for their employees, suggesting the policy would be unworkable. 'Nobody is forcing anybody to volunteer and no one is forcing companies to organise this volunteering if it causes problems to the company,' Mr Pickles told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He added there would need to be 'a bit of give and take' with the Prime Minister's plan. The Communities Secretary insisted it would not add to costs in the NHS, with potential gaps having to be filled by extra agency workers. 'We're talking about three days and it would be worked out according to patterns of work and it will be worked out to ensure that it doesn't cause inconvenience to the health service,' he said. The former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said Mr Pickles had given a 'car crash' interview. He tweeted: 'If yesterday's Michael Fallon interview was a car crash, Eric Pickles just caused a motorway pile-up #r4today.' Mr Pickles suggested companies would not be forced to give staff days-off for volunteering under the plan Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott offered his view on Pickles' interview on the Today programme The Labour party raised concerns about the cost of the policy. Shadow minister Lisa Nandy said: 'This is a re-announcement from David Cameron that has unravelled before it's even been made. 'Giving every public servant three extra days off could cost millions of pounds but there's no sense of how it will be paid for. If just half of public sector workers took this up it would be the time equivalent of around 2,000 nurses, 800 police and almost 3,000 teachers.'", "reference": "prime minister announced plan to amend working times regulations . mr cameron wants workers to have three paid days off to do good deeds . he described announcement as demonstration of the big society in action . immediately afterwards eric pickles suggested it would n't be enforced . john prescott described mr pickles ' interview as a ` car-crash ' .", "sentences": ["david cameron announced plans to give millions of workers three days paid to be paid .", "but business leaders criticised move as heavy-handed government intervention .", "but business leaders criticised move as heavy-handed government intervention .", "but business leaders criticised move as heavy-handed government intervention ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "NoE", "OtherE", "OtherE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "GramE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"david cameron announced plans to give millions of workers three days paid to be paid .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Although it tries to convey that Cameron proposed three days\u2019 paid leave, the phrase \\\"three days paid to be paid\\\" is grammatically malformed to the point that the proposition is not clearly expressed.\",\n    \"category\": \"grammatical error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but business leaders criticised move as heavy-handed government intervention .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that business leaders, such as the IoD\u2019s Simon Walker, called the policy \\\"heavy-handed government intervention,\\\" matching the sentence exactly.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but business leaders criticised move as heavy-handed government intervention .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Same content as previous sentence and fully supported by the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but business leaders criticised move as heavy-handed government intervention .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Again repeats a supported claim from the transcript without contradiction.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["grammatical error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

The Conference bent over backwards to help them.I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier.

Disgruntled fans vented their anger at their chairman outside of Bloomfield Road before a 1-1 draw with Reading, hurling eggs at the directors' boxes windows and launching a flare, smoke bomb and firework in front of the main entrance to the West Stand, where Oyston and his family usually watch games. They repeatedly chanted for Oyston to leave a club that became the first in the Football League to be demoted following Rotherham's win over Brighton on Easter Monday. Lee Clark admitted Blackpool face a challenge to win back their stay-away fans after relegation Jamie O'Hara scored from the penalty spot to give Blackpool a lead during the draw against Reading But defender Grant Hall scored an own goal just after half-time to leave Lee Clark disappointed Yakubu tussles with Costa Rica international Jose Cubero, who enjoyed a rare start for Blackpool Some of those fans did not even enter the ground and missed a contest short on incident, with Grant Hall's own goal 20 seconds after the restart earning the Royals a point following Jamie O'Hara's opening goal for the hosts from the penalty spot. Clark acknowledged that a 'horrendous season' had contributed to the swathes of empty seats at recent home matches but is hopeful of winning back those disillusioned fans by rebuilding his squad over the summer. 'We're down a level and that's going to be hard,' he said of getting fans back through the turnstiles at Bloomfield Road. 'We've obviously had a horrendous season to put up with, but if we do it right with our recruitment process over the summer, we do things in the right way and get the right type of players in - then they can come and watch us over the pre-season and see a new group of players that they can get excited about that we can get them back on to the seats. 'The only way we can do that is by getting a group together that's going to give us a fighting chance to get back up and we hit the ground running at the start of the season.' Blackpool fans gathered outside Bloomfield Road to protest against the Oyston family Blackpool's main reception at Bloomfield Road was pelted with eggs before their game with Reading Those that did opt to turn up saw bottom-of-the-table Blackpool gain a third successive draw to move to 25 points, one away from the lowest ever total accrued by a side in the second tier when there have been 24 teams. Following the confirmation of their relegation, Clark was keen to produce a performance for the long-suffering Seasiders faithful. 'It was important that we did put on a lively performance because with the news (on Monday) it has been tough for everybody, but more importantly it's been tough for the supporters,' he stressed. 'I just thought it was important we gave them some kind of performance. I just wish we could have got a victory.' A fan walks out of a Fish and Chips shop, next to a shop selling t-shirts and banners supporting protests Reading had made a nightmare start, conceding just six minutes in when O'Hara converted from 12 yards after Zat Knight had upended Gary Madine from behind. But it was the visitors who were quick off the mark in the second period as a shot from Aiyegbeni Yakubu struck Hall in the face and went over the line.

The spacecraft  that lost contact with flight controllers will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in about a week, Roscosmos, the Russian Federal Space Agency, said Wednesday. Roscosmos (the Russian Federal Space Agency) announced that the Progress will not be docking and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere, Kelly said from the space station. The Progress resupply vehicle will come off its orbit and will begin its combustion in the atmosphere between May 5 and May 7, according to Roscosmos. The Progress vehicle does not present any danger to the International Space Station due to a significant difference in orbit, Roscosmos added. The Russia space agency said it is working on its next supply flight to the ISS and expects to launch a new Progress ship in the third quarter of this year. Russia lost contact with ISS Progress 59 during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. The ship is now spinning out of control, NASA said. Even if Russia hadn't lost contact with the craft, the original plan was for Progress to burn up re-entering Earth's atmosphere -- albeit with garbage rather than a full load of equipment for the space station. According to NASA information on the Progress resupply vehicle, After the cargo is removed and before the Progress undocks, the crew refills it with trash, unneeded equipment and wastewater, which will burn up with the spacecraft when it re-enters the Earth's atmosphere. The cargo spacecraft launched successfully early Tuesday from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. But after it separated from the Soyuz booster rocket's third stage, Russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft's systems, including the deployment of navigational antennae, NASA said. The spacecraft made another pass over Russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system, the American space agency said in an update. A planned rendezvous with the ISS six hours later was initially postponed to Thursday but has now been canceled, NASA said in its latest update. Docking has been called off for the Progress 59 spacecraft, it said. Russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be. Additional information will be provided as it becomes available. Few details have been forthcoming so far from Roscosmos. According to NASA, the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food, fuel, oxygen, spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station. But the hitch will not put the six ISS crew members at risk, NASA said. The spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the station, a statement said. Both the Russian and USOS segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight. That next flight, which will be the seventh SpaceX commercial resupply services mission to the space station, is not scheduled  to take off before June 19, NASA said. Meanwhile, Russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with Progress 59 as it passes over Russian ground stations. NASA said Tuesday that Russian flight controllers had confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it. According to Russian state news agency Tass, six attempts to make contact were to be made Wednesday. The U.S. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station's environmental control and life support system, backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing, all of which are replaceable, NASA said.

The waiting list for social housing has increased a lot over passing years.They need to think about how they can use that social housing stock efficiently.If they can sell high-value housing to invest in more social housing and find more homes for more people, then that is certainly something they should look at.But Labour said the coalition's failed polices were making the housing crisis worse not better.Shadow housing minister Jack Dromey said: Councils and housing associations should make effective use of their housing stock but the government should not force them to arbitrarily sell off social homes, breaking up mixed communities and driving out hard-working families on low wages from whole neighbourhoods.He said the government should use a bank bonus tax to fund 250,000 affordable homes and put unemployed builders back to work and boost the construction industry.'Lucky family'Expensive social housing - which Policy Exchange defines as housing worth more than the average property in each region - accounts for 21.8% of the total social housing stock in the UK, it says.This equates to 816,000 properties - out of a total of 3.78 million - which the think tank says could raise up to \u00a3159bn if sold.It says London alone has more than \u00a370bn of expensive social housing.About 3.5% of the total stock becomes vacant every year owing to people moving out or dying, the think tank said.This meant the government could sell a total of 28,500 properties each year, raising \u00a35.5bn a year. The figure would stand at \u00a34.5bn after paying off the debt held against the stock, the report said.Mr O'Brien argued that many hard-working people might want to live in a nicer area or in a bigger house but could not afford to.Rather than having one lucky family with a very expensive house, you would have two families perhaps desperately waiting for social housing, now having a roof over their heads.That seems fairer to me, he added.The think tank also said the move would be extremely popular with all sections of society, claiming that 73% of people, including social tenants, think people should not be given council houses worth more than the average property in a local authority.'Dramatic erosion'Critics say such a move would push the least well-off out of expensive streets, and into new ghettos.The National Housing Federation, which represents housing associations, says many towns would be cleansed of hardworking people who can't afford to pay high prices.Labour MP Karen Buck, who represents Westminster North, is concerned that lower income families, particularly in London, will be forced out of more affluent areas creating segregated communities of rich and poor.Ms Buck also argued that the Labour government's \u00a38bn social and affordable housing building programme was cut by 60% when the coalition came to power.Housing Minister Grant Shapps - who is in favour of a sell-off - said the government had introduced radical reforms to get Britain building and to reduce social housing waiting lists.They included investing \u00a319.5bn public and private funding into an affordable housing programme set to exceed expectations and deliver up to 170,000 homes.Councils could now offer fixed-term tenancies to new tenants to make sure social housing goes to those in greatest need, he added.", "reference": "councils should consider selling off their most expensive houses to build more cheap homes, the government says.", "sentences": ["the right to be built in social housing should be scrapped in a bid to boost the housing market, a think tank has said."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the right to be built in social housing should be scrapped in a bid to boost the housing market, a think tank has said.\",\n    \"reason\": \"Policy Exchange suggested selling high-value social homes to fund new building; it did not say any \u2018right to be built in social housing\u2019 should be scrapped, so the reported predicate is not supported by the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"predicate error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "reference": "richie benaud died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . his commentary style is considered synonymous with cricket . sportsmail recalls 10 of his best moments in the commentary box . read : when richie benaud welcomed viewers , they were able to relax . click here for richie benaud tributes as cricket world mourns legend .", "sentences": ["Richie Benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .", "Benaud spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight , authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe .", "Sportsmail recalls 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Richie Benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This is stated verbatim in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Benaud spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight , authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says he \\\"spoke with an unrivalled blend of insight, authority and wit from commentary boxes at cricket matches across the globe,\\\" matching the summary exactly.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Sportsmail recalls 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that Sportsmail \\\"recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career,\\\" so the summary accurately reflects this.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Gaioz Nigalidze, the current Georgian champion, was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament when he was found using his phone in the middle of a match. The two-time national champion was exposed when his opponent lodged a complaint when he grew suspicious about his frequent trips to the lavatory. Tournament organisers found Nigalidze had stored a mobile phone in a cubicle, covered in toilet paper. They announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page. The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it.

Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament\u00a0announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence,\u00a0Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages.

And late last year, it bought the four-year-old MinecraftEdu version of the game from Finland-based independent developer TeacherGaming.It is now promising to add features, but schools may face extra costs.It says more than 7,000 classrooms around the world already use Minecraft in some form.Teachers are using Minecraft to do so many things, including teaching maths, science, religion and poetry, Anthony Salcito, Microsoft's vice-president of worldwide education, told the BBC.Once we make the tools easier for schools to get access to and employ, I think you'll see that number [of classrooms] grow quite quickly.MinecraftEdu already allows teachers to modify content in the game and use a shared library of education-themed assets.Microsoft is promising to improve the experience by:To access the service, children and teachers each need their own Office 365 ID, which can also be used to provide access to the Microsoft's cloud-based productivity software.Microsoft says this will help teachers minimise the number of online accounts they need to manage.But it may also help the company promote its word processing, email, and file-sharing apps over rival services from Google and others.Microsoft intends to charge an annual fee of $5 (\u00c2\u00a33.50) for each teacher and child.That could prove more expensive than the current basic set-up, where schools pay a one-off fee of $14 multiplied by the maximum number of people they want to be able to log in at once, plus an additional $41 for server software.We believe we are bringing added value, said Deirdre Quarnstrom, director of Minecraft education.On top of having a persistent identity, they will also have access to the most current version of the game.MinecraftEdu, along with other Minecraft mods, was one to two releases behind by nature of the development process.We are also replacing the need for schools to have and maintain separate server hardware.The new features were welcomed by Leigh Wolmarans, the head teacher of Lings Primary School in Northampton.His school already uses MinecraftEdu to teach pupils about A Midsummer Night's Dream by asking them to create a performance of Shakespeare's play within the game.However, he said other teachers should be aware the software had its limitations.Technology can lead to exceptional learning, but it has to be used in conjunction with other tools, he said.If all you are doing is sitting them down and leaving them to experience Shakespeare through Minecraft, you would be doing something wrong.Dance, art, drama and music remain the best ways to teach kids.But technology can add to that as an additional tool.Microsoft said it would allow teachers to start beta-testing Minecraft's education edition at some point in the summer without charge, ahead of its formal rollout.", "reference": "an ``education edition\\'\\'of minecraft is to be launched by microsoft.", "sentences": ["microsoft has launched a version of minecraft-the world\\'s most popular version of the minecraft computer game-in its uk and canada."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "GramE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"microsoft has launched a version of minecraft-the world's most popular version of the minecraft computer game-in its uk and canada.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript only says Microsoft will allow beta-testing of a forthcoming Education Edition and never mentions an actual launch, nor any roll-out limited to the UK and Canada, nor a claim about it being the 'world's most popular version', so the statement adds information not in the source and misstates the action taken.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

encouraged to seek help if they are in distress and helped to identify sources of support.The workshops also provide teachers with basic training in promoting emotional wellbeing.The Healthy Me initiative was launched at Carrick Primary School in Lurgan, County Armagh, on Friday morning.The school's pastoral care co-ordinator, Helen Hamilton, is also its P7 teacher and said the programme has helped pupils and parents ahead of the big move.I see the anxiety in kids starting to build about secondary school, Ms Hamilton told BBC News NI.No fault of the secondary school - they're excellent and many are very excited to be going there - but they're apprehensive too and a lot of the time, that can be fed down from parents as well, they're worried about them.You're going from a very close-knit family atmosphere in a primary school - where you have one teacher who sees a child every day all day, and gets to know them and their wee quirks and can spot very quickly if they're out of sorts - to the very difficult job of senior school teachers who see them maybe for half an hour.It's more difficult for them to pick up on those things, much as they try, so parents sometimes need the reassurance and understanding that the transition can be easier than they expect.Getting a place in a secondary school can be source of stress however, and last month, thousands of P7 pupils began to sit this year's unofficial transfer tests, set by two different examination bodies, the Association of Quality Education (AQE) and GL Assessment.Pupils have the choice to sit either test, both tests, or none, but figures provided to the BBC by the two organisations indicated a slight rise in the number of entrants sitting the tests this year, with a total of 14,681, a rise from 14,575 in 2015.Transition from primary to secondary school is a particularly stressful time for children and we believe that targeting the programme at P6/P7 children will help them cope with this transition, Mr Babington said.Modern life is stressful and can impact on mental health, so implementing strategies for protecting children from stress and helping them learn to cope with change is an extremely positive influence on their young lives, the Action Mental Health boss added.Ms Hamilton said that in the workshops, children were taught breathing exercises, and how to relax, including how to take time out from busy after-school activity regimes.We, as a school, value so much the amount of evidence that shows that children who, mentally and emotionally, aren't ready to learn cannot progress, so   it's so important for us that children's social and emotional needs are met, the P7 teacher added.The need to strengthen the resilience of young people is one of the key challenges facing Northern Ireland's education system, according to the chief inspector of schools, Noelle Buick.All young people need to build resilience, she wrote in her  latest report, published last month..The chief inspector said pupils were facing complex challenges because the social context of relationships, values, attitudes and behaviours in which children and young people live and learn has changed significantly in recent years.It is timely to review the need for strengthening the resilience of children and young people at all levels through stronger and more explicit preventative education within the wider taught pastoral care curriculum.", "reference": "pupils preparing to leave primary school are being taught how to deal with stress and to be more resilient as part of a new mental health initiative.", "sentences": ["a charity is launching an initiative to help children in northern ireland who have mental health problems."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\": \"a charity is launching an initiative to help children in northern ireland who have mental health problems.\", \"reason\": \"The initiative is aimed at helping all P6/P7 pupils cope with change and stress, not specifically children who already have mental health problems.\", \"category\": \"entity error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

The new openings held back the like-for-like sales total over the period, it added.Chief executive John Walden, who said it had been another rather eventful period for the company, was pleased with the improvement in Argos' sales.Shares in Home Retail closed down almost 0.5% at 179.1p, but have risen more than 80% this year following Sainsbury's interest in Argos.The supermarket has argued that combining both chains would create a world-leading retailer bigger than rivals John Lewis and Amazon UK.Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: Home Retail claim that underlying like-for-like sales were broadly flat, once the cannibalisation from the infamous concession inserts in Homebase and Sainsbury are taken out. Gross margins were up, however, by 75 basis points and Home Retail's year-end net cash was strong.Sainsbury's had offered about 167p a share for Home Retail, but will be forced to at least match the 175p-a-share all-cash offer from Steinhoff, which owns UK furniture retailer Harveys.However, the supermarket may be reluctant to increase its offer to the level needed to win control of Argos.Analysts have also questioned the wisdom of Sainsbury's acquiring the struggling retailer.", "reference": "argos, the retail chain at the centre of a bidding war, has shown a fall in sales over the christmas period.", "sentences": ["argos owner home retail group has reported a 23% rise in like-for-like sales to # eight-week m in the first half of the year."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE", "GramE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\": \"argos owner home retail group has reported a 23% rise in like-for-like sales to # eight-week m in the first half of the year.\", \"reason\": \"The transcript states that like-for-like sales at Argos fell 1.1% in the eight-week period; it does not mention any 23% rise or anything about the first half of the year, so the predicate (reporting a big rise) contradicts the source data.\", \"category\": \"predicate error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["predicate error"]}

In an op-ed published by The New York Times on Wednesday,  Nick Loeb explained his rationale for fighting to keep the two female embryos he shares with the actress. I wanted to keep this private, but recently the story broke to the world, Loeb wrote. It has gotten attention not only because of the people involved -- my ex is Sofia Vergara, who stars in the ABC series Modern Family -- but also because embryonic custody disputes raise important questions about life, religion and parenthood. Loeb says he met the actress in 2010 and they got engaged two years later, at which point they decided to create the embryos and conceive a child via a surrogate. After two attempts failed to bring fertilized embryos to term, they created two more embryos using her eggs and his sperm. When we create embryos for the purpose of life, should we not define them as life, rather than as property?, he said. ... A woman is entitled to bring a pregnancy to term even if the man objects. Shouldn't a man who is willing to take on all parental responsibilities be similarly entitled to bring his embryos to term even if the woman objects? Loeb said he filed a complaint against the 42-year-old actress to prevent her from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization. He filed it in August in Santa Monica, California, where they apparently lived while they dated. We signed a form stating that any embryos created through the process could be brought to term only with both parties' consent. The form did not specify -- as California law requires -- what would happen if we separated, he said.  I am asking to have it voided. Representatives for Vergara have declined to comment in the past. Loeb has said he believes life begins at fertilization and wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term. He said he doesn't want any money from the egg donor. The case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos. Typically, a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority, said fertility specialist Dr. David Tourgeman, who's not involved in this case. Usually when embryos are created, whether the couple is married or just consenting adults, there's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos, if they are frozen for future use, he said. In most cases, the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney, although anyone can make a request, Tourgeman said. If there's a disagreement, the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos, he said.

It depends on which airline rewards program you've chosen, which route you're flying and when you book your ticket, according to a new Consumer Reports study of 70 million passenger trips over the past two years. The magazine collected statistics comparing award-seat availability for the five biggest U.S. airlines on domestic routes. The top performer was Southwest Airlines, which offered the most award tickets, 11.9 million, and the highest percentage of award tickets -- 11.5% of 103.1 million total passenger seats. The high number of award tickets is directly related to Southwest's unique combination of 'Every Seat is an Award Seat,' no blackout dates, points that don't expire, and a route map that reaches more than 90 different destinations in the U.S. and beyond, making us the largest domestic carrier in the U.S., Southwest spokesperson Thais Conway Hanson told CNN. Unlike other carriers, we also don't charge fees for close-in bookings or penalize you for canceling your trip if something else comes up. At the bottom of the list was JetBlue, which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest U.S. airlines: 892,000 one-way passenger tickets, or 4.5% of its total 19.7 million U.S. seats. (JetBlue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study.) Many JetBlue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year, making it hard to accumulate miles, an airline spokesman told the magazine. By not allowing miles to expire anymore, the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them. Delta Air Lines came in second place with 5.6 million U.S. award seats; United Airlines ranked third with 5 million U.S. award tickets; and American Airlines was fourth with 3.5 million U.S. award seats. What are the world's safest airlines? Remember that award tickets aren't actually free. The cost of miles is built into everything you buy that's earning you miles, and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all. So it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully. On average, nearly 10% of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by Consumer Reports flew on domestic award tickets, but some of them weren't getting the best value for their miles. While many U.S. fliers redeemed miles on American Airlines flights from Los Angeles to San Francisco, the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket, Consumer Reports says. Better to use them on American Airlines' route between New York and San Francisco or Delta's route between Chicago and Los Angeles, which are generally more expensive than that Los Angeles-San Francisco route, according to Consumer Reports' calculations. While award-seat availability is important, it may not matter as much as passengers' overall satisfaction with an airline. Southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score (86), followed by JetBlue (85), Delta (70), American (66) and United (63). And don't forget the fees.

In Aintree's crowded unsaddling area, the former England captain was making a beeline to the place marked with a big number '3', with his wife, Zara Phillips, scampering in hot pursuit. Not even a hug from AP McCoy could check his momentum. No wonder. Tindall was beaming from ear-to-ear having just seen Monbeg Dude, the horse whom he owns with James Simpson-Daniel and Nicky Robinson, run his heart out and wanted to be in place for when the old warrior, who was sent off unconsidered at 40/1, returned. Former England rugby captain Mike Tindall and wife Zara Philipps at Aintree ahead of the Grand National Tindall celebrates after watching his horse\u00a0Monbeg Dude finish third in the National Monbeg Dude is now 10 and, according to his jockey Liam Treadwell, 'likes to do things at his own pace' but his resolution is not in question and this was the latest wonderful day he had given his owners and trainer Michael Scudamore. Think about this for a CV: a Welsh Grand National in January 2013, victory in a big chase at Cheltenham in December of the same year and being placed in a Hennessey Gold Cup at Newbury last November, then this. Not bad for a horse that cost \u00a312,000. While the exultant connections of winner Many Clouds were celebrating a few yards away, their joy was almost matched by the happiness of the Monbeg Dude team; as Michael shook his head in wonder, his father Peter, the former champion jump jockey, dashed to engulf him in a bear hug. Here was thumping evidence that no other race stirs the emotions quite like the Crabbie's Grand National. The \u00a388,400 was by far the biggest pot Monbeg Dude has collected in his 24-race career but the reactions of Tindal et al (ITALICISE) showed this was about far more than money. 'Pride is the word I would use,' said Michael Scudamore. 'I am so happy for the horse. He is unbelievably tough and brave. To put in a performance like that after coming here last year (finishing seventh), I am just so proud. The owners are buzzing, so is the jockey.' Many Clouds and Aspell jump a fence on the way to winning the 2015 Grand National at Aintree Treadwell's contented look as he strolled to the Owners and Trainers tent a little while after said as much. He won the Grand National in 2009, when steering Mon Mome to a 100/1 success, but this was the first time he had ridden in the race since 2010, when unseating at the 20th from Nozic. 'I am absolutely delighted,' said Treadwell. 'The horse didn't even know he had been in a race. He got hampered at Becher's Brook the first time and that checked his momentum but he has given me a fantastic ride. 'Last year he looked like he was going to be the winner going to the last and there was a point when I thought my run was going to take me there this time but he just flattened out a bit at The Elbow. But what a great day. I really appreciate everything about this atmosphere now.' He wasn't the only one.

Stancil is accused of killing an employee Monday at Wayne Community College in Goldsboro, North Carolina. Relatives have said victim Ron Lane was gay, CNN affiliate WNCN reported, and investigators are looking into whether the shooting was a hate crime. Authorities arrested Stancil after he was found sleeping on a Florida beach on Tuesday. Just a few minutes into Thursday's hearing on the first-degree murder charge he faces, Stancil snapped back at the judge after he was offered a court-appointed lawyer. No, I don't need one, said Stancil, who stood before the judge with his legs shackled and his arms handcuffed in front of him. You know what I'm saying? I knew I would get life anyway. Superior Court Judge Arnold O. Jones interjected, pointing out that the maximum sentence Stancil faces is the death penalty. Yes, I know that, Stancil fired back. But when I knew what I had to do and I knew when I got caught, you know, I knew in my mind that I could get life, I could get the death penalty. You know what I'm saying? Do you follow my topic? I would have killed you, you know what I'm saying, if you're a f---ing child molester. The judge told him not to swear. I don't give a f--- what you want, Stancil said, lunging forward and lifting up the table in front of him. Deputies quickly corralled him and hustled him from the courtroom. The hearing resumed about 25 minutes later, when Stancil was brought back into the courtroom, this time with his arms handcuffed behind him. When asked again by Jones whether he wanted a lawyer, his response was quick -- and calm. Yes, sir, he said. In an interview with CNN affiliate WRAL, Stancil described himself as a neo-Nazi and said he hates gay people with a passion. Stancil had worked for Lane, the school's print shop operator, as part of a work-study program, but was let go from the program in early March because of poor attendance, college officials said. During the interview, and during a court appearance in Florida on Tuesday, Stancil said Lane deserved to die, accusing him of being a child molester who'd made advances in online messages to Stancil's 16-year-old brother. Lane's family has described those accusations as untrue and slanderous. His cousin, Steve Smith, told WRAL that Lane never made sexual advances toward children or anyone with whom he worked. He described him as a loving man who was dedicated to family and friends. Yes, Ron was gay. But people need to get over it, Smith said.

Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final.

The country is due to repay a \u00a3330million loan to the International Monetary Fund on Thursday but there were concerns the heavily indebted nation would default on the payment. Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time. Greece has denied it will miss a repayment of \u00a3330million to the International Monetary Fund after reports it had drawn up plans to introduce a parallel drachma currency to pay its bills He said: 'We strive to be able to pay our obligations on time. We are ready to pay on April 9.' Sources close to the ruling Syriza party claimed the government was prioritising paying wages and pensions over any loans due, according to the Telegraph. It  reported that the nation no longer has the funds to repay the debt unless the eurozone agrees to pay the next portion of its interim bail-out deal in time. A senior official told the newspaper: 'We are a Left-wing government. If we have to choose between a default to the IMF or a default to our own people, it is a no-brainer. 'We may have to go into a silent arrears process with the IMF. This will cause a furore in the markets and means that the clock will start to tick much faster.' German magazine Der Spiegel quoted a finance ministry general secretary, Nikos Theocharakis, as saying Greece would probably not pay next week's IMF tranche, prompting a further denial from the Greek finance ministry. Theocharakis said Greece would be 'close to the end' on April 9 and called the technical teams from its creditors 'completely useless,' according to an extract of the article due to be published on Saturday. 'Mr. Theocharakis never characterised the technical teams of the institutions with the phrase attributed to him,' the ministry said in a statement. 'On the contrary ... he referred to them as saying they include 'top-notch people with impressive skills.'' Deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas (pictured) said that Greece will in fact make the payment on time Germany's Spiegel Online quoted Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt as saying that Greece postponing the repayment due on April 9 was 'out of the question', otherwise a Greek exit from the eurozone could no longer be ruled out. He said the Eurogroup would not release further funds to Greece until Athens implemented some of the reforms it had promised. Athens has not received bailout funds since August last year and has resorted to measures such as borrowing from state entities via repo transactions to tide it through the cash crunch. The government is hoping approval of its latest reforms package will unlock remaining aid of 7.2 billion euros under its EU/IMF bailout and lead to the return of about 1.9 billion euros in profits made by the European Central Bank on Greek bonds. Mardas said, without providing figures, that state revenue in March had topped targets and that the government had made progress in talks with lenders on its latest reforms list.

Otherwise you have a ban for Chernova that really looks quite ineffective.Chernova's backdated ban is due to expire on 21 June, and with the qualification period for the 2015 World Championships in Beijing running until 10 August, she could compete both there and at the 2016 Rio Olympics.It would be frustrating if she lines up on the starting line but those are the rules out there and we need to abide by them, said Minichiello.That is why we think Wada needs to look at its code and penalties to show there is potentially a loophole that needs to be looked. I'm sure the Russian anti-doping agency have administered suspensions according to the rules, so therefore it needs to be looked at.Last week, Russia's athletics head coach Valentin Maslakov resigned after a number of athletes from the country were found guilty of committing doping offences.Wada is investigating allegations of widespread doping and corruption in Russian athletics after claims were aired in a recent German television documentary, with a report due to be published by the end of the year.The IAAF said last week it was concerned about the number of Russian doping cases in the sport.", "reference": "jessica ennis-hill\\'s coach toni minichiello wants russian heptathlete tatyana chernova\\'s drugs ban to be re-examined by the sporting authorities.", "sentences": ["jessica ennis-hill\\'s world champion jessica ennis-hill has been banned for two years for failing a drugs test."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"jessica ennis-hill's world champion jessica ennis-hill has been banned for two years for failing a drugs test.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The ban discussed in the transcript was imposed on Russian heptathlete Tatyana Chernova, not Jessica Ennis-Hill, so the subject of the sentence is incorrect.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (\u00a3675,000) to $50,000 (\u00a334,000).Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems, FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence, said Snoussi.But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page, said Snoussi.We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.", "reference": "tunisia and morocco\\'s differences with the confederation of african football (caf) are in the past, both north african nations say.", "sentences": ["equatorial guinea\\'s rich squad has been forced to pull out of the 2017 africa cup of nations in gabon."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"equatorial guinea's rich squad has been forced to pull out of the 2017 africa cup of nations in gabon.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript never mentions Equatorial Guinea withdrawing from the 2017 AFCON; on the contrary, the discussion centers on Tunisia\u2019s possible expulsion and Morocco\u2019s ban, so this claim is unsupported and false.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

Barry Beavis launched a legal bid to overturn his fine, saying it was unfair, disproportionate and unenforceable. But in a landmark ruling, appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither 'extravagant or unconscionable'. Motoring groups reacted in fury to the decision, accusing the judges \u2013 who are thought to earn more than \u00a3200,000 a year \u2013 of being 'out of touch'. Mr Beavis, from Chelmsford, Essex, had gone to court to fight what he called the 'bullying and threatening' private car park firms which heavily penalise motorists who overstay in parking spaces. The 48-year-old, who runs a fish and chip shop, got the \u00a385 fine in April 2013 when he overstayed by 56 minutes in a private car park at the Riverside Retail park in Chelmsford. The car park, run by parking firm ParkingEye Ltd, allowed two hours of free parking, but Mr Beavis stayed for three. He claimed the \u00a385 charge against him was disproportionate and vowed to fight the companies who 'extort money by threatening and bullying people into paying up'. But yesterday judges said the fine was enforceable because it was not 'excessively high'. Mr Beavis said he was 'absolutely furious' and planned to appeal. Meanwhile motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys and would open the floodgates for unscrupulous profit-hungry firms 'falling over themselves' to ramp up the already hefty penalties they impose. Ian Taylor, of the Alliance of British Drivers, said: 'I think the judges are somewhat out of touch if they think \u00a385 isn't extravagant. 'An \u00a385 penalty may not seem much to a rich lawyer \u2013 it's probably less than many charge for an hour. But for the average hard-pressed motorist trying to make ends meet, it's a very heavy and unfair burden.' Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said the ruling would hand parking firms a 'blank cheque' to milk drivers, adding: 'This decision could cost motorists millions. 'If judges believe \u00a385 is not an extravagant amount then what is? \u00a3100? \u00a3200? Our fear is that parking firms will now be falling over themselves to raise their penalty charges and punish drivers.' Mr Beavis had parked his car at the Riverside Retail Park in Chelmsford, pictured above, on April 15, 2013, The retail site, pictured above, offers two free hours of parking and Mr Beavis was fined after he returned 56 minutes late Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer watchdog Which?, said: 'We are concerned that this decision waters down the law on penalty charges and may encourage excessive default charges.' And AA president Edmund King said: 'Britain's motorists really will think judges are out of touch with everyday life if they consider \u00a385 to be a reasonable amount of money for a parking penalty. \u00a385 may not seem much to highly paid lawyers but it represents a great deal of money to cash-strapped motorists.' He added: 'This is a licence to print money for people who have now been handed an open cheque-book and invited to make up the figures as they like.' Speaking outside of the Court of Appeal Mr Beavis said he would now be taking the case to the Supreme Court Parking trap: Many motorists face steep fines for running a few minutes over their allotted time The three judges who unanimously dismissed the challenge \u2013 Lord Justice Moore-Bick, Lord Justice Patten and Sir Timothy Lloyd \u2013 are all thought to earn around \u00a3202,000 a year. Yesterday ParkingEye welcomed the judgment, saying it gave 'clarity to motorists and the parking industry' and 'further confirms that our parking charges are fair, reasonable and legally enforceable'. But speaking outside court, Mr Beavis said: 'These firms are not run on a moral basis, they're only out to make as much money as they can, to profiteer from unsuspecting motorists. I am utterly furious and will continue the fight.' Mr Beavis's action comes after the Daily Mail revealed how rogue firms are making millions of pounds from fines handed to motorists who overstay \u2013 sometimes for only a few minutes \u2013 in car parks at hospitals, railway stations and shopping centres. Cancer sufferers and patients whose treatments have over-run are among those who have been ripped off by the parking firms. Three judges unanimously dismissed his challenge at the Court of Appeal, saying the amount he was charged 'is not extravagant or unconscionable'.", "reference": "barry beavis took on private car park operators over ` unfair ' charges . 48-year-old tried to challenge # 85 fine that he claimed was unjust . left ` furious ' after losing the landmark legal bid at the high court . judges found the charge was ` not extravagant or unconscionable ' .", "sentences": ["barry beavis , 48 , launched a legal bid to overturn his fine , saying it was unfair , disproportionate and unenforceable .", "appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ` extravagant or unconscionable ' .", "motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"barry beavis , 48 , launched a legal bid to overturn his fine , saying it was unfair , disproportionate and unenforceable .\",\n    \"reason\": \"All details\u2014Beavis\u2019s age, his legal challenge, and his description of the fine\u2014are explicitly stated in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"appeal court judges decided the size of the fine was neither ` extravagant or unconscionable ' .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript quotes the judges ruling that the \u00a385 charge was not \\\"extravagant or unconscionable.\\\"\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"motoring groups said the ruling was a victory for the parking cowboys .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states motoring groups described the decision as \\\"a victory for the parking cowboys.\\\"\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Klopp, 47, announced earlier this week that he would end his seven-year stint at Borussia Dortmund when the current season draws to a close, prompting fresh speculation that he could head for the Premier League. Manchester City have already indicated that a man who has also been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal in the past, is not in their sights, but Germany international Mertesacker insists Klopp would be a good fit in the English top flight. Jurgen Klopp has revealed he will be vacating his role as Borussia Dortmund boss at the end of the season Arsenal vice-captain Per Mertesacker says Klopp would be a top manager in the Premier League Klopp chats with Dortmund defender Erik Durm during a training session in Dortmund on Wednesday He said: 'I've got some nice experiences in the Premier League and of course it would be nice if a German coach would take the challenge of working in the Premier League. 'It's not so good for Dortmund that he is leaving but hopefully one day he will manage abroad. I think his passion would fit and to see him in England would be very interesting. 'Everyone has their philosophy and I think Jurgen Klopp has proved that he's top-level and can teach a lot.' However, Mertesacker insisted Klopp, whose side are 10th in the Bundesliga table, will need time to decide on his future after a largely successful spell in Dortmund which has brought two league titles and a Champions League final appearance. He said: 'I think he should just finish the season with Dortmund and then he should be given time. 'We'll see what he does next, but I think he's fought his way out of all situations and I think that this time he will find a path that gives him a new challenge. 'But firstly, I wish him all the best and time to think about his achievements. Sometimes you can underestimate what it's like going straight into a new job. I think you should give him time - and I wish him all the best.' Klopp waves to the fans after Dortmund's Champions League game against Arsenal in November The German boss has enjoyed a huge amount of success at Dortmund and won the Bundesliga title twice But for all that a new challenge lies ahead for Klopp, Mertesacker admits he cannot work out what has gone wrong to prompt his exit from Borussia. He said: 'It is obviously sad news for Borussia Dortmund, [he was] such a passionate successful and passionate manager for them. He was the guy who turned it around at Dortmund. 'The whole situation there - he built the squad on young players and they improved so much in the seven years he was in charge. It is a sad situation. 'But in the summer, it will be a new situation for him. Maybe he is going to go abroad and see how it goes there. 'I would love to see more German managers abroad, because it is obviously a new challenge, to adapt to the culture, the language, the system. Yes, why not? 'It is his decision. He worked really hard and pushed really hard, so even if he said he is not tired, maybe he takes a bit of breather to fuel his energy and his batteries? 'But I am curious what happened to him because he was an outstanding figure in the Bundesliga in the last couple of years and always a title contender. They went to the Champions League final.

Now, a study has found it may make your brain larger, too. Physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain, increasing the size of areas that contribute to balance and coordination, according to\u00a0Health Day news. The changes in the brain may have health implications in the long-term, such as reducing the risk of falling, said the study's author, Dr Urho Kujala, of the University of Jyvaskyla. Scroll down for video Exercise can increase the size of areas of the brain that contribute to balance and coordination, a study found It could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age, he added. Dr Kujala said physical activity has already been linked to a number of health benefits, such as lower levels of body fat, reduced heart disease risk factors, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. But he and his team wanted to understand how exercise affects the brain. They recruited 10 pairs of identical twins, who were all men aged 32 to 36 years. Focusing on twins, who have the same DNA, would allow researchers to see how their environment affects their bodies. In each pair of twins, one brother had exercised more over the past three years than the other, though they reported they carried out similar levels of exercise earlier in their lives. Dr Kujala said: 'On average, the more active members of twin pairs were jogging three hours more per week compared to their inactive co-twins.' The twins had MRI scans of their brains so researchers could see whether physical activity had any impact on the size of their brains, and specific regions. Exercise didn't seem to affect the size of the brain as a whole, Dr Kujala said. But there was a connection between more activity and more brain volume in areas related to movement, he added. Previous research found exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat, a reduced risk of heart disease, better memory and thinking, and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes The twins who exercised more did a better job of controlling their blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes, a finding which is already well-known. The study was published in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. It comes after US researchers found regular exercise can also make you smarter. University of South Carolina experts found\u00a0regular treadmill sessions create more mitochondria -\u00a0structures in the cells that produce the body's energy - in the brain. This energy boost helped the brain to work faster and more efficiently, effectively keeping it younger, researchers said. In the short term this could reduce mental fatigue and sharpen your thinking in between gym sessions. And building up a large reservoir of mitochondria in the brain could also create a 'buffer' against age-related brain diseases such as Alzheimer's.", "reference": "study : exercising increases the amount of grey matter in the brain . it makes areas of the brain that control balance and co-ordination bigger . in the long term this could reduce the risk of falling or becoming immobile . previous studies show exercise can stave off alzheimer 's and diabetes .", "sentences": ["physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain .", "it could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age .", "exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat , a reduced risk of heart disease , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "CorefE", "EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["OutE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that physical activity can increase grey matter in the brain.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"it could also reduce the risk of being immobile in older age .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says the study found exercise could reduce the risk of being immobile in older age.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"exercise is linked to lower levels of body fat , a reduced risk of heart disease , better memory and thinking , and a lower risk of type 2 diabetes .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states exercise is linked to all these health benefits.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

While the BBC claimed the plate, which read H982 FKL, was an 'unhappy coincidence', Maria Cristina Barrionuevo said they were deliberately 'provoking people' when they drove it through the country last year. In a report released earlier this week she slammed their actions as 'arrogant and disrespectful'. Scroll down for video A judge has ruled the controversial number plate that led to Jeremy Clarkson and his Top Gear colleagues being thrown out of Argentina was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War Clarkson and his colleagues fled the South American country last year when their convoy - which was led by a Porsche bearing the controversial number plate - came under attack. A village of Falklands War veterans targeted the team as they drove through Patagonia, with Clarkson claiming in one account that they stormed their hotel. They were accused of deliberately inciting conflict with the plate, an alleged reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Afterwards producers removed the plate and replaced it with another. Investigating whether this was illegal, Mrs Barrionuevo said: 'It should be understood that it is not up to me to investigate or evaluate the decision - arrogant and disrepectful to say the least - by the Top Gear production team to enter the country with one or more Malvinas-referenced number plates. 'Nor is it my job to gauge the reaction - anticipated - of citizens to such an offence. Clarkson (pictured this week) said an angry mob targeted the Top Gear team in their hotel. His producer, Andy Wilman (right), who announced his resignation on Wednesday, denied deliberately using the plate 'My responsibility is to analyse whether a crime has been committed under Argentinian law in relation to the removal from the Porsche of the original number plate H982 FKL and its replacement by another.' Concluding Top Gear chiefs had not acted in 'bad faith' in changing the plates and their hand was forced by 'massive government and popular pressure', she added: 'It led them to remove the original number plate and replace it with another which in principle wouldn't have negative connotations with the aim of ending the main focus of conflict and avoiding violent reactions by locals which indeed ended up taking place. 'The change was not done in a surreptitious way, but with the knowledge and approval of the presenters who participated in meetings with the programme producers.' Local prosecutors have already been informed of the decision and are understood to be preparing an appeal. Judges in the nearby city of Rio Grande - where Clarkson\u2019s Porsche is thought to be in storage - are now expected to be asked to order Clarkson and his pals to be called in for a court grilling by overturning Mrs Barrionuevo's decision. The group's convoy was attacked as they drove through Patagonia. They abandoned the cars in Argentina to flee the country Clarkson, 55, and co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May fled Argentina with a police escort after being told to leave the country as angry Falklands War veterans threatened to kill him. They cut short filming for a Christmas special and took flew to the capital Buenos Aires before returning to Britain. Nearly 30 other members of the film crew were stoned as they headed for Chile by road and had to abandon Clarkson\u2019s Porsche and the cars his co-hosts had driven on a 1,400-mike trip through southern Argentina. The number plate that sparked calls for a full criminal probe - HI VAE - was found on the battered Porsche which was attacked by a furious mob after it was left at the side of the road. A local councillor in Ushuaia later claimed the digits 269 on the number plate of the Ford Mustang Richard Hammond had driven were close to the 255 Britons killed during the war - and the numbers 646 on James May\u2019s Lotus could be taken as a reference to the 649 Argentinian casualties. The furore sparked a diplomatic incident with Argentina\u2019s ambassador Alicia Castro calling the H982 plate 'malicious mockery' of those who fought in the 1982 Falklands War. Andy Wilman, who this week announced he was resigning from the show, insisted it was 'completely untrue' the Clarkson car had been chosen for its number plate or that an alternative plate was substituted for the original one. Clarkson told the Argentinian ambassador she could 'go fooey' ahead of the screening of the Top Gear special last December. The presenters were filming a Christmas special in the South American country last year when the controversy erupted He is now rumoured to be working on a new car show format with Wilman which they are expected to take to a rival British TV channel, Netflix or Amazon. They were spotted in London on Thursday with Richard Hammond and James May, entering Clarkson\u2019s home before leaving together for a drink at a local pub. Hammond, 45, has joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear following Clarkson's sacking, insisting yesterday/on Friday he had no plan to 'quit my mates.' Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. The incident led to the BBC deciding not to renew Clarkson\u2019s contract after the current Top Gear series finishes. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would \u2018not be pursuing the matter any further.\u2019", "reference": "the plate - h982 fkl - was on clarkson 's porsche during christmas special . local veterans considered it a reference to the bloody 1982 falklands war . angry villagers attacked top gear convoy and the team fled the country . judge ruled the number plate was deliberate reference despite bbc denial .", "sentences": ["Maria Cristina Barrionuevo ruled plate was a reference to 1982 Falklands War .", "She said Top Gear team were deliberately ` provoking people ' when they drove it through the country last year .", "BBC claimed the plate , which read H982 FKL , was an ` unhappy coincidence '"], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Maria Cristina Barrionuevo ruled plate was a reference to 1982 Falklands War .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Judge Maria Cristina Barrionuevo ruled the H982 FKL plate was a deliberate reference to the 1982 Falklands War, so the sentence is fully supported.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"She said Top Gear team were deliberately ` provoking people ' when they drove it through the country last year .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly says Barrionuevo declared they were deliberately 'provoking people' when driving through Argentina, so this matches the source.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"BBC claimed the plate , which read H982 FKL , was an ` unhappy coincidence '\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript notes that the BBC said the H982 FKL plate was an 'unhappy coincidence', aligning perfectly with the summary statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?.' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.'

Shooter: Heavily armed tactical teams swarmed to the campus amid reports the shooter had barricaded himself inside 'This started and ended in D.C.,' an FBI source told WUSA. The shooter tried to ram the gates before firing at the guard at least once, according to reports. The campus, built in 2006 and employing thousands, was locked down until about 9pm as authorities unsure where the shooter had gone quickly swarmed. According to the Associated Press, the guard was shot after noticing a couple fighting in a car. He went to investigate and it cost him his life. Sharp shooters positioned themselves outside the campus as authorities sought to determine where the shooter had fled Reports: Reports from the scene indicated that loud bangs rang out inside the campus around 8pm, but it wasn't immediately clear if they came from guns or, perhaps, from police 'flash-bang' grenades used to disorient suspects The guard died before 10pm after he was taken to a Washington area hospital, NBC reported. But the gunman trail of violence continued back into DC. Witnesses say some 40 cruisers finally boxed the shooter's green Honda in at 11th and H Streets in Northeast D.C.

Michelle Manhart, 38, was handcuffed by police at Valdosta State University, Georgia, and driven off in a patrol car after grabbing the Stars and Stripes and refusing to return it to the student demonstrators. Video footage of the event, on Friday, shows Manhart struggling with officers, who force her to the ground after she refuses to let the flag go. Scroll down for video Struggle: Manhart, 38, is shown, left, refusing to release a flag which protesters were trampling on. In the right-hand photograph she is seen being arrested at Valdosta State University in Georgia Cause: Manhart came to the campus because she heard students were walking on the flag, as seen above It shows her surrounded by protesters on the campus, who demand their property be returned. In response, Manhart says the flag belongs to 'the entire United States'. Campus police try to convince her to drop the flag, but Manhart, a former training sergeant who served in Kuwait, refuses. Speaking to the Valdosta Daily Times about her intervention, she said: 'I did not want anything like this, but I got a call from a student who told me that the flag was on the ground, and they were walking on it. 'I was just going over there to pick up the flag off the ground. I don\u2019t know what their cause is, but I went to pick it up because it doesn\u2019t deserve to be on the ground.' She continued: 'If your cause is racism then find some white people and walk on them. 'But to walk on the flag is walking on our symbol of freedom. You have the freedom to do what you are doing because of it. I\u2019m not fighting against them. I\u2019m fighting against the way they are going about it.' It is not clear what the demonstrators were rallying against. They did not answer reporters' questions about what their cause was. Air Force to bare force: Manhart was once a Staff Sergeant at the San Antonio Air Force training camp (right), but was demoted when she appeared nude in Playboy magazine. She is shown left holding a copy of the issue containing her spread According to the Daily Times, the group didn't want to press charges against Manhart. However, police gave her a trespass warning, which bans her from the campus. Manhart has come under fire for standing up for her beliefs before. In 2007 she made national headlines - and lost her job - for posing nude for Playboy magazine. Explicit photographs from the periodical's February 2007 issue show then-Sergeant Manhart in a variety of provocative poses - first with, then later without - her military uniform. Cover girl: After her original feature, Manhart appeared in Playboy again. She is shown here on the cover of the Mexican edition When Air Force bosses got wind of the racy feature, they relieved her of her duties at the Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. She was later demoted, and ultimately left the Air Force. However, she remained defiant, telling reporters at the time 'I didn't do anything wrong, so I didn't think it would be a major issue'. The decision brought an end to 14 years of service She later appeared in other editions of Playboy - including the cover of the Mexican edition - \u00a0and posed for animal rights group Peta to support an anti-fur campaign. The Daily Times reported that Manhart now intends to hold a pro-military counter-demonstration in the town on Wednesday. In response to the incident, the university's president says he disapproves of the flag-trampling protest, but recognizes their right to express themselves that way if they choose. Dr William McKinney said: 'The American flag represents everything that is best about our country. As the Supreme Court has held, one of those things is the right to free speech, which includes the right to disrespect even the symbol of our country.

She did not lift a finger, she was a lazy thing.The inquest heard Ms Ziuzina sold her husband's Range Rover, contents from his flat and moved funds from his bank account.The hearing was also told she was entitled to the first \u00c2\u00a3200,000 of his estate and that computer records revealed she was having an affair with a Ukrainian man.Greater Devon coroner Dr Elizabeth Earland said strenuous attempts had been made to get her to attend the inquest, but without success.In a statement, Ms Ziuzina said she had made three separate statements to Ukrainian police and did not believe she could add anything further.Det Con Jonathan Watts, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said Mr Pring was hit by a car with no lights, speeding at 75mph.He also said witnesses at the scene in Kiev described the killing as a deliberate act.The Ukrainian police closed an inquiry into his death, but relaunched it in 2011 as a murder inquiry.

The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion'. But that her party want 'chaos and constitutional crisis' at Westminster to force another independence referendum. Scroll down for video Gordon Brown, pictured campaigning this week, has warned that the SNP want to use the chaos after the election to force another referendum on Scottish independence and urged 'patriotic Scots' to vote Labour And he warned that those casting their vote on May 7 will be deciding the future of Scotland for the next few years. Mr Brown was speaking during a joint event with local Labour candidate and shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander at Elderslie Village Hall in Renfrewshire. He said: 'There is an SNP candidate in this constituency. She says vote SNP, get SNP MPs at Westminster and we will twist their arms and get another referendum. 'Remember what the SNP used to say - the referendum was once in a generation, then it changed a little to once in a lifetime, then it was once every 15 years and now when you ask Ms Sturgeon about this her answers are all evasion. She cannot give a straight answer to the question. 'But does not the SNP candidate in this constituency tell the truth, that what they want is an SNP vote not to deliver social justice but to deliver the chaos and constitutional crisis at Westminster to as she said force a second referendum. 'And I say I don't want the divisiveness, I don't want the bitterness, I don't want the acrimony, I don't want the divisions between families and communities in the next few months that we had in the past few months.' The former prime minister said that SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon's answers on the issue are 'all evasion' Mr Brown urged people to vote Labour to end the bedroom tax, food bank poverty, zero-hours contracts and the neglect of the NHS. He added: 'When you vote on May 7 remember that you are not just voting to end Tory austerity and the possibility of five more years of the bedroom tax and everything else, you're also voting on whether you are going to allow the SNP to use your vote to try to force a second referendum on this country within a few months or after the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections.' He also said that Labour will hold an economic summit immediately after the General Election to boost jobs, expand city deals, encourage investment and provide jobs and training for young people. Mr Brown also urged people to be 'proud patriotic Scots' and back Labour's plan for full employment in Scotland. He said: 'Patriotism means, yes, supporting a strong Scottish parliament, but it doesn't mean rejecting the co-operation across the whole country that can deliver us full employment and more jobs. 'It doesn't mean rejecting the money that comes from the bankers' bonus tax that will allow Scottish young people to have jobs in the future.

We wish them every success in the futureThe task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland's top flight by winning the Championship this season.We expect high calibre candidates, and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation, as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say.Speaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium, Stubbs admitted it was a really difficult decision to leave Hibs, but that moving to the Championship in England was the next chapter for his career.Rotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart.I was impressed by what the chairman had to say, what his vision is for the club and the ambition, he explained.The club's had two seasons where they've stabilised in the Championship and we're looking to take the club forward.

And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club.Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs, Stewart said.

Preparing for their weekend clash at home to West Ham United, Manuel Pellegrini's  stars were all in action at their Etihad Campus base. Fresh from scoring Premier League goals 99 and 100 in his City career,  striker Sergio Aguero was back to his menacing best as he took part in shooting practice against goalkeeper Joe Hart. Manchester City players were  trained on Wednesday ahead of their match on Sunday at home to West Ham City striker Sergio Aguero fine-tuned his finishing skills with some shooting practice at their Etihad Campus Yaya Toure (left) and Samir Nasri are reportedly two players who could leave the club in the summer Aguero, who signed a new five-year contract with the club in August, will certainly be one player who will remain at the Etihad next season. The same cannot necessarily be said for Yaya Toure and Samir Nasri - who are reportedly two players  City are willing to listen to offers for in the summer. And the midfield duo looked out in the cold at one point during Wednesday's session as they appeared  as Nasri underwent some stretching exercises. In the aftermath of Sunday's defeat to United at Old Trafford, Sky Sports pundits Gary Neville and Graeme Souness were highly critical of Toure. Of the 31-year-old, the latter said that he had become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Toure was criticised by Sky Sports' Gary Neville and Graeme Souness after City's loss at Manchester United 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why Both the Ivory Coast international and Nasri have come under criticism for recent displays on the pitch, but Pellegrini will still be calling on their services as they look to cement a top four finish this season.

Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music \u2014 that's not exactly a phone-in.

Barrientos, originally from the Dominican Republican, lived with her partner and two children in the Bronx until her arrest in February, however was legally married to at least four people at the time. In court today, prosecutors said Barrientos married men from\u00a0Egypt, Bangladesh, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Pakistan, Mali and Georgia - countries that were 'red flags' for immigration, according to\u00a0The New York Daily News.

Authorities only cottoned on after she said her 2010 marriage to Salle Keita, of Mali,\u00a0- \u00a0the tenth time she tied the knot - was actually her first, the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported. This launched an investigation that unraveled a totaly of ten times Barrientos has allegedly walked down the aisle. Barrientos would spell her name differently on some marriage licenses and would file all over the state, in places including Westchester County, Mamaroneck, White Plains, Ramapo and Long Island, investigators said. Six of the sham marriages occurred in one year, authorities allege. The Daily News reported that it was her eighth husband, Rashid Rajput, that was deported to his home country of Pakistan following an investigation by the Joint Terrorism Task Force. She has pleaded not guilty to two felony charges of filing a false instrument, involving marriage licences. 'This is a huge breach in security,' national security expert Manny Gomez told WABC.

James Creag, 11, is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside. He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires' because their skin cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. James Creag must use the special brown suncream (pictured) as he suffers from a rare sunlight allergy He suffers from the condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria, which means he suffers from terrible sunburn (pictured) when exposed to sunlight James, from Salford in Greater Manchester, was given Dundee Reflective Sunscreen, a thick brown paste which blocks out the light. But when strangers shouted out abuse such as 'chocolate face' and 'you're coloured' because of his unusual appearance, he refused to wear it any more. His mother Claire, 34, said: 'When he had the cream on he was called names - the kind of names a racist would say. I don't know why. 'It was either ignorance or evilness. People think he's different so they taunted him. It's so cruel. I hate that people take the mickey out of him. 'The cream was meant to protect him but he's stopped wearing it now.' The unfortunate schoolboy has to wear a long-sleeved shirt, trousers, and gloves in all weather so he is not harmed by the sun, which would be like having 'boiling water poured on him'. However, his condition can also can flare up when he is inside, so his parents have installed specially dimmed windows to block out the sun's rays. 'His school got new lightbulbs in October,' Mrs Creag said. 'Immediately he started getting pins and needles and his body swelled up. He was in agony, I was so worried. 'It turned out he was suffering a reaction to the new daylight bulb lights. The school put a special coating over them and now he is lots better. Family: James with his mother Claire and younger sister Grace, who does not have the condition EPP occurs when there is a build-up of a chemical called protoporphyrin in the blood. The skin is more sensitive to longer ultraviolet wavelengths (UVA) and to visible light. It is caused by a shortage of an enzyme in the body that normally converts the protoporphyrin into a substance called haem. As a result of this enzyme deficiency, protoporphyrin levels build up in the blood. As blood passes through the skin, the protoporphyrin absorbs the energy from sunlight and this sets off a chemical reaction that can slightly damage surrounding tissues. The nerve endings in the skin interpret this as itching or burning pain, and if the blood vessels are affected, they can leak fluid, causing swelling. The condition is hereditary and symptoms include developing tingling, itching and burning when exposed to sunlight. There is currently no cure. Source: British Skin Foundation She added: 'He was first diagnosed when he was two. He was playing football in the garden with my husband, Daniel. 'But after half an hour outside, they came running towards me, James screaming. He said his hands hurt. They had swollen up so much they looked like boxing gloves. 'I put them under the cold tap and looked at him. His skin was red hot and burning. It was far worse than sunburn - his hands were three times the size.' The family visited their GP, who suggested that James might be allergic to grass. 'He was given steroid tablets to help with the swelling and we were sent away,' his mother said. 'But it kept happening and I took James to the doctors three times that week. 'Painkillers and allergy tablets didn't help. Every time he was outside, any exposed skin became red raw, his face and hands would swell up. He would scream in pain and no sun cream made any difference.' Eventually he was referred to hospital and diagnosed with the rare condition. 'We were told to wrap him up and use the special cream,' Mrs Creag added. 'So, even if it's overcast, James still wears a hat, scarf and gloves to cover every inch of his skin. The Dundee cream is so important.' She spoke of her joy at discovering that her daughter Grace had not inherited the illness despite the genetic risks - and paid tribute to James for his bravery. 'Even after all he's been through James is brilliant,' Mrs Creag said. 'He is your typical 11-year-old lad. Even when he is flaring up, he just shrugs his shoulders. I admire him. 'He always wears a hat too He just puts up with it though. He\u2019s so brave and doesn\u2019t let it get him down. Even though other kids can play football in the sunshine.' Mrs Creag continued: 'Doctors said his EPP was an inherited condition. Daniel had a variant gene, I had a mutant gene. So when I fell pregnant with Grace I was terrified she\u2019d be born with EPP too. 'Luckily she wasn't.'", "reference": "james creag suffers from rare condition erythropoietic protoporphyria . he wears a thick brown sunscream to block out harmful rays which would leave him in agony . but after strangers taunted him with racist abuse he stopped using it .", "sentences": ["james creag , 11 , is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside .", "he suffers from the condition erythropoietic protoporphyria , whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires ' because their skin can not be exposed to direct sunlight ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"james creag , 11 , is so sick of being taunted that he has stopped putting on the special cream - meaning that it is not safe for him to go outside .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This statement directly matches a sentence in the transcript and is factually accurate.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"he suffers from the condition erythropoietic protoporphyria , whose victims are nicknamed 'real-life vampires ' because their skin can not be exposed to direct sunlight .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This statement also appears verbatim in the transcript and is factually correct.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error"]}

In a startling new tutorial YouTube star Promise Tamang turns herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the  movie of the same name. But where the mother-of-six wore cheek prosthetics to achieve the unnaturally sharp cheekbones, Promise's bone structure is a result of clever contouring. Scroll down for video In a new Youtube tutorial Promise Tamang has turned herself into Maleficent, Angelina Jolie's character from the upcoming movie of the same name This isn't the first time she has transformed herself into a Disney character though. Promise has previously made videos of herself as Elsa from Frozen and Princess Jasmine from Aladdin. When she posted a picture taken from the tutorial to Instagram many of her followers couldn't believe their eyes. One commented: 'this girl is RIDICULOUSLY TALENTED! She can make herself look like anyone with her makeup shading including lips! Crazy.' On the video she reveals her step-by-step process beginning with a thick all-over pale foundation. Over the top of that she sucked in her cheeks to begin the contouring technique made famous by Kim Kardashian. But while the reality star makes sure her maquillage is properly blended, Promise shows how she draws a sharp line diagonally along the length of her cheekbones to create the character's highly chiselled bone structure. In the four minute film Promise takes her followers through the steps to transform herself into Maleficent Here promise is seen heavily contouring her face having applied heavy eyebrows and a pale base To highlight them even more, she added another layer of even paler make-up to the tops of her cheekbones and under her eyes. Next came perfectly applied berry lipstick and long black eyelashes applied with tweezers. The finished result is uncannny as she dons a latex headdress with horns just like Jolie's own in the retelling of the classic Sleeping Beauty fairy tale. One commenter wrote: 'Your [sic] amazing at what you do. Promise has been posting YouTube make-up tutorials for six years now having started her channel in 2009 and now has 2.8 million subscribers. On her YouTube profile she writes:  'I use make-up to transform myself into famous celebrities and characters. 'It started out as a hobby 4 years ago and now I am here using this awesome platform to teach and entertain millions around the world.' Promise colours her lips in before adding a Mac lipstick on top - the make-up brand created a collection inspired by the film Promise uses a pair of tweezers to place false eyelashes onto her eyelid Her Facebook page states: 'I am not a professional make-up artist nor did take any lessons in it. I am purely self taught!' Along with Disney princesses, she's also transformed herself into the likes of Drake, Johnny Depp and Michael Jackson. In the four minute video Promise talks her viewers through the steps that she took to get her Maleficent look. She uses many products from Mac's Maleficent collection including the eye shadows and eyelashes. Here we look back at some of her other amazing looks...

Sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the Rhinos against Sheffield Eagles at Headingley in 1997 and he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion, with the Wolves running out 29-10 winners. The Rhinos were already trailing 20-4 when the former England skipper entered the action five minutes into the second half and it did not get much better as the Yorkshiremen came up with their worst performance of the season in front of a 17,430 crowd. Warrington Wolves forward\u00a0Roy Asotasi crosses for one of his side's five tries on the night Warrington had produced their best display in an 18-6 win over Leeds in March and they were again outstanding, with full-back Stefan Ratchford and second rower Ben Currie the pick of an impressive bunch. Leeds had an early chance when prop Adam Cuthbertson was held up over the line but then it was virtually all Warrington as they established a stranglehold on the game. Loose forward Ben Harrison was held up on his back before his back-row partner Currie produced a measured grubber kick on the last tackle to create a try for winger Gene Ormsby. Leeds Rhinos winger Kallum Watkins does brilliantly to touch down in the corner It was then Harrison's turn to demonstrate his kicking skills to get his captain Joel Monaghan in for a second try, although there was a strong hint of a forward pass in the build-up. With scrum-half Richie Myler causing all sorts of problems for the Rhinos defence with his penetrative running, the visitors were good value for their 8-0 lead and it got even better for them on 23 minutes when prop Ashton Sims took hooker Mick Higham's pass near the line to go through a gaping hole for a third try. Ratchford was off target with his first two attempts at goal but it was third time lucky as he made it 14-0 and a Higham 40-20 kick enabled Warrington to maintain the momentum. Warrington forward Ben Harrison is tackled by Stevie Ward during a frantic contest at Headingley Sinfield stayed on the bench throughout the first half but the introduction of forward Mitch Achurch helped perk up the Rhinos in the last 10 minutes and they pulled a try back in scintillating fashion when winger Kallum Watkins finished off a flowing move at the corner. The Leeds captain entered the action five minutes into the second half but his side were trailing 20-4 by then after a break by lively substitute Daryl Clark created the position for Ratchford to get Currie over for Warrington's fourth try. And there was no way back for Sinfield's men when Ormsby's neat offload enabled substitute prop Roy Asotasi to score his first try for more than 12 months. Leeds Rhinos veteran Kevin Sinfield made his 500th appearance for the club on Friday night Ratchford kicked his third goal to stretch his side's lead to 26-4 and increased it with a penalty on 63 minutes after Jamie Peacock was pulled up for a high tackle. The home side pulled a try back five minutes later through Achurch and Sinfield kicked the goal but it was little more than consolation and the Wolves had the final say when stand-off Declan Patton slotted a drop goal to open his account for the club on his third appearance.", "reference": "kevin sinfield made his 500th appearance for leeds . warrington registered tries through gene ormsby , joel monaghan , ashton sims , ben currie and roy asotasi . leeds replied with kallum watkins and mitch achurch .", "sentences": ["kevin sinfield 's 500th appearance for leeds as they completed a notable double over the super league leaders in emphatic fashion at headingley .", "sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the rhinos against sheffield eagles at headingley in 1997 .", "he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion , with the wolves running out 29-10 winners .", "leeds had an early chance when prop adam cuthbertson was held up over the line", "but then it was virtually all warrington ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["GramE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["EntE", "GramE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["CorefE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"kevin sinfield 's 500th appearance for leeds as they completed a notable double over the super league leaders in emphatic fashion at headingley .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The sentence implies Leeds (\\\"they\\\") completed the notable double, whereas the transcript states it was Warrington who achieved the double over Leeds, the Super League leaders.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"sinfield was on the losing side on his debut for the rhinos against sheffield eagles at headingley in 1997 .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Matches the transcript exactly.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"he was powerless to prevent a repeat on his landmark occasion , with the wolves running out 29-10 winners .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Accurately reflects the transcript that Warrington won 29-10 and Sinfield could not prevent it.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"leeds had an early chance when prop adam cuthbertson was held up over the line\",\n    \"reason\": \"Correctly restates the early chance described in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"but then it was virtually all warrington .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Faithfully summarizes the transcript's statement that play was thereafter dominated by Warrington.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error", "no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

Elton, who distanced himself from the party under Tony Blair, told supporters he was 'back with Labour'. He said: 'It's no secret that I am now one of that wealthy minority. Me and Myleene Klass.

'Apparently we are the ones that sneer. Really? Have you seen the Black and White ball? 'Just a little bit of sneering going on I think.' Long-time Labour supporter Eddie Izzard said the party would offer a 'fair chance for everyone'. Actress Sally Lindsay told the crowd 'it makes me sick' that people are having to turn to foodbanks because they cannot afford to eat. The former Coronation Street star backed Labour's plans to ban exploitative zero-hours contracts and called for a 'decent minimum' wage. Coronation Street actress Sally Lindsay joined Justine Miliband and Eddie Izzard at the campaign event Joey Essex was among the crowd at the rally where Ed Miliband announced a \u00a35 billion Future Homes Fund 'That's why I'm voting Labour, that's why I support Ed.' Martin Freeman, one of Britain's most bankable Hollywood stars, was the first celebrity face to back Labour's 2015 General Election campaign.

'We will build at least 200,000 homes a year by the end of the Parliament. 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land. 'Waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: either you use the land or you lose the land. 'We will build a new generation of towns, garden cities and suburbs creating over half a million new homes. Ed Miliband, speaking at the rally, \u00a0said a Labour government would 'get Britain building again' 'We will make housing the top priority for additional capital investment.'

The impact was minimal and we were, along with our Caf colleagues, able to make it pass.Morocco were punished in February after being replaced as 2015 Nations Cup hosts last November, just two months before the competition began.The North Africans refused to stage the tournament in January 2015, citing fears over importing the Ebola virus, and asked for a postponement of either six or twelve months instead.Earlier this month, Cas overturned Caf's ruling and reduced a fine imposed on Morocco's FA from $1m (\u00a3675,000) to $50,000 (\u00a334,000).Equatorial Guinea stepped in to stage the 2015 finals, despite having just 64 days to prepare.The host nation was also at the centre of the incident that led to Tunisia's row with Caf, which the local federation (FTF) says is now over.I am convinced that the page has been turned and that there will no longer by any problems, FTF vice-president Maher Snoussi told BBC Sport.Seeking their first Nations Cup triumph since 2004, the Tunisians were leading 1-0 in the 90th minute of their quarter-final against the hosts when they were awarded a highly contentious penalty.The spot-kick was converted and Equatorial Guinea went on to win 2-1 in extra-time, as the Tunisian players and bench largely lost their heads as tempers flared.The Tunisians wrote a furious letter to Caf in response, which prompted African football's ruling body to demand an apology by 31 March 2015 or face disqualification from the next Nations Cup.Contrary to media reports, the Tunisia Football Federation insists it never accused Caf nor Mauritian referee Rajindraparsad Seechurn of corruption.We never spoke of corruption because we had no evidence, said Snoussi.But we were strongly convinced that the referee sought out an unjustifiable penalty, and that perhaps he was influenced by the atmosphere inside the stadium.But we never accused either him or any Caf member of corruption. We simply said the referee was very badly chosen and we contested that a 45-year-old, coming towards the end of his international career, should have been selected.In our famous letter, we said that the commission in charge of appointing referees had to assume responsibility for appointing a referee incapable of handling the match.Tunisia's 2017 participation seemed in doubt until a meeting with Caf president Issa Hayatou and others in Senegal in mid-March led to a rapprochement.Luckily, with the strong pressure of Issa Hayatou, with whom I had a meeting in Dakar where we discussed our difference, we've managed to turn the page, said Snoussi.We are very happy to be playing the (2017) Nations Cup and I feel this difference has been now completely ironed out.Following last week's draw in Cairo, Tunisia will face Togo, Liberia and Djibouti in Group A while Morocco will Cape Verde, Libya and Sao Tome in Group F.Should the Tunisians reach the 2017 finals in Gabon, they will reach their thirteenth straight Nations Cup - which would be a record.", "reference": "tunisia and morocco\\'s differences with the confederation of african football (caf) are in the past, both north african nations say.", "sentences": ["morocco\\'s bid to host the 2017 africa cup of nations in gabon has been postponed after the confederation of african football (caf) upheld their suspension."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["EntE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["RelE", "CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"morocco's bid to host the 2017 africa cup of nations in gabon has been postponed after the confederation of african football (caf) upheld their suspension.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Morocco's ban from the 2017 Nations Cup was overturned, that Gabon (not Morocco) is hosting the 2017 finals, and there is no mention of any Moroccan bid to host; thus nearly every key fact (host, suspension status, postponement) is wrong.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

The Prime Minister this morning faced the first serious criticism of the campaign so far, as Tory donors rounded on the party's lacklustre message and failure to pull away in the polls. But a defiant Mr Cameron this afternoon pledged to continue focussing on bread-and-butter issues like jobs, business and childcare. Scroll down for video David Cameron this afternoon hit back at growing criticism over his election campaign \u2013 vowing to carry on warning about Labour's threat to the economy He told supporters in Somerset: 'If you want political excitement. Go to Greece. If you want more showbiz in this election. Go to Hollywood. 'But here and now in the UK I'm focused on something real \u2013 a stronger economy.' Mr Cameron insisted the economy 'excites' millions of people. He said he would campaign on 'more jobs, more homes, more business, more childcare, more security in retirement'. He said: 'I make no apologies for focusing hard on that which is central to everything. When you get a new job, a new home, get a new childcare place or start a new business\u2026 now that's truly exiting. 'And you only get these things with a strong and stable government - not one held to ransom. That's not the excitement 'Britain needs. That's not a risk Britain should take.' Mr Cameron's remarks comes amid claims senior Tory figures are already planning to make Boris Johnson the next leader. Some MPs are prepared to engineer a coup against Mr Cameron in the days after May 7 by submitting letters of no-confidence in him and planning a 'mass show of support' for the London Mayor if the Tories lose, the Sunday Times reported. One major donor, who declined to be named, told the newspaper: 'Boris is the only one who can win. Everyone knows what is going to happen in 10 days' time. If Dave doesn't make it we'll get rid of him.' The Tories have nudged ahead in the polls with less than two weeks to go until polling day, but Tories are increasingly concerned it may be too little too late London Mayor Boris Johnson - appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, has distanced himself from claims that he is being lined up to replace David Cameron as Tory leader Multimillionaire Tory donor Peter Hall, who has given almost \u00a3600,000 to the Tory party since 2005, meanwhile has criticised Mr Cameron's 'curious lack of energy and belief in his campaign.' He said the PM needs to raise his game and 'unleash visceral passion and belief in his vision of the future', 'get down and dirty', as well as showing 'he cares', if he is to win on May 7. 'If we don't have a Conservative government after May 7 it will be because of David Cameron. His decision not to keep those Ukip people in the Tory tribe was a key error. 'I see no powerful vision of the future provided by David Cameron. There is no clear considered view of where we are headed.' Mr Hall warned that Cameron's mantra as a sound steward of the economy 'is not enough to win the votes needed to win the election' and added: 'Some people are really quite resigned to losing and they are planning the next step. 'It's a horrifying prospect if we were to lose.

Both skipper Kellock and Hall - who have played nearly 300 matches between them for the club - are to retire come the end of May and each have a maximum of six outings left of their distinguished professional careers. And while Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend was naming his full squad for the Blues match on Thursday, he announced that the second-row and hooker would start in the pack against the Welsh outfit. Glasgow Warriors veteran Al Kellock will start at lock against Cardiff Blues at Scotstoun on Friday night The encounter is being billed as a tribute to them both and, in a nice touch by the club, the match ball will be presented by Kellock's dad and Hall's mum along with Alistair Johnson, who was Kellock's best man, and Bernie Mitchell, who was an inspirational figure for Hall coming through at Hillhead/Jordanhill. Having been a pro player for 13 years and earned 42 Scotland caps, Hall admits it will be a strange feeling hanging up his boots for good at the end of the current campaign. 'You get to a point where you start thinking to yourself 'this could be the last game of rugby I ever play' so you want to make the most of it,' the 34-year-old said. 'I really want to enjoy these last few games, but also stay focused and help the Warriors secure a play-off place and hopefully the trophy. Glasgow hooker Dougie Hall is hanging up his boots after 13 years of professional rugby As retirement draws closer you do start to think more about the things that you love about the game. You start to think about your last team huddle, the last time you will walk out onto the pitch with your team mates and it is those moments that I will miss incredibly.' Since he first played in the equivalent of the PRO12 for Edinburgh Rugby back in 2002/03 Hall has seen the standard of all of the sides improve incredibly. As a result, despite the fact that the Warriors are first and the Blues are 10th in the table, he does not expect an easy night, far from it. 'They have a number of quality players in their side and a lot of internationals while all of the teams are getting better year on year,' he explained. 'We really have to concentrate on what we are doing ourselves and keep getting results and hopefully that takes care of things and gets us into the play-offs in the coming weeks. 'I hope that gone are the days when the PRO12 is looked on as a lesser league, the teams and the talent involved now really is top class.' Gregor Townsend's Glasgow side are currently top of the Pro12 standings ahead of Cardiff's visit This season Hall has been restricted to seven appearances in the PRO12 for the Warriors to date, Fraser Brown and Pat MacArthur playing the majority of minutes with Kevin Bryce also pushing hard for game time in the number two jersey. And while Hall himself admits that he may not be in the gym as often as the younger trio, he feels the experience he has gained in over 140 match for the club can still help during the league run-in and in the play-offs. 'The last thing you want to do when you have played for all those years is to pick up an injury in the gym,' Hall explained. 'For me now it is all about managing myself throughout the week so that when it comes to getting out on the field I can give it everything. 'As you get older you perhaps become a bit more of a leader in the group, but I like to think I have acted like that since I came to the Warriors in 2007. Wales prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for Cardiff as the loosehead struggles with a calf strain 'I was the starting hooker for a number of years and as Pat, and more recently, Fraser and Kevin have come in I hope they have learnt from watching what I do and also have learnt from what I say too.' Meanwhile, Cardiff Blues prop Gethin Jenkins is a doubt for the match with a calf strain. The injury forced the Wales and British & Irish Lions' man off last week in his side's European Rugby Challenge Cup quarter-final defeat to the Dragons. 'Gethin has got a calf strain but it is not as bad as we thought. He hasn't trained this week so is a doubt, but he is keen to play a few more games for us yet this season,' Blues attack coach Paul John said.

His first in the dugout was as assistant to Ruud Gullit in August, 1999, when on a sodden night at St James' Park the Dutchman left out Alan Shearer and Duncan Ferguson and paid for his selection with his job after a 2-1 defeat. Carver is now fighting to win the head coach position beyond the end of this season and knows what impact a victory \u2013 or a loss \u2013 could have on Sunday afternoon. John Carver is relishing the chance to take charge of his hometown club against Sunderland on Sunday Gullit controversially decided not to start star players Duncan Ferguson and Alan Shearer in 1999 Carver was assistant to former Newcastle manager Ruud Gullit who managed the club between 1998 and 1999 His memories of Gullit's downfall remind him of such consequences. 'We were at the old training ground at Durham Cricket Club and I was in the room with Steve Clarke and Ruud,' recalls Carver. 'All of a sudden, he started talking about what the team was going to be against Sunderland. I said, 'Sorry Ruud, what did you say there?'. 'He said he was going to leave out Alan and Duncan. I said, 'Do you know how important this game is?'. 'He said, 'I have played in some massive derbies. I've played in them in Holland and London and I played in the Milan derby too'. 'I said, 'Yeah, but you haven't played in one like this Ruud'. 'And then we just walked out of the room. He seemed set on the fact that was what he was going to do. 'I talked about it being a motivation for the opposition seeing Alan and Duncan on the bench. But he had no concerns whatsoever. 'I actually thought, 'If we don't win it, he's gone'. I said to Steve, 'Is he writing his resignation before the game?'. Gullit's selection gambit did not pay off and Newcastle ended up losing 2-1 to Sunderland at St James' Park 'We actually went 1-0 up but they turned it around and then the heavens opened. It was a dreadful night.' The following morning Shearer went to see Gullit, only Ferguson had beaten him to it, knocking the door off the hinges, legend has it. By the end of the week he had quit. Carver was also by Alan Pardew's side during the last four derby defeats, a factor the former manager admits did him little favours with the Toon Army. In that respect, Carver knows how much a positive result could aid his chances of landing the job on a permanent basis. 'In the eyes of the fans, if you win a derby game, it's massive,' he said. 'I'm not saying everything else is forgotten, but it certainly helps your case. If I come off and it's not been a football match but we win 1-0, I'll be delighted with that. 'We had a good football match last weekend (2-1 defeat at home to Arsenal) and got nothing for it. At the end of the day, it's all about getting the win.'

'I have heard of the saying grow old gracefully but I don't understand it.' Grandmother-of-three Pat lost her husband 12 years ago to prostate cancer after dutifully caring for him during the last nine years of his life following his diagnosis. Now she's focused on enjoying herself and wants to make the most of the time she has left. She said:\u00a0'I have cared for people all my life. I don't want to look after someone full-time again, I want to look after me now. 'Whatever time I have left I am going to party and love it till I die.' Pat in another of her risque outfits gets to grips with an Elvis impersonator in Menorca While Pat likes to hit the town at night, during the day she hits the gym and also enjoys pole-dancing lessons. Thanks to keeping fit and active, she says she feels confident about her appearance as she nears 70 and as a result, she is happy to show off her body in a number of 'kinky' outfits. Her wardrobe includes a risque fancy dress police woman look, air hostess and French Maid outfits, as well as a leather jumpsuit, and she teams them all with\u00a0stilettos. She said: 'I like to dress sexy, if I can't walk in high heels, I won't go outside. I just like to have fun and feel good in whatever I wear. 'For my age I don't have a bad body. I can walk into a room and I still turn heads and I like that.' Pat, pictured again with the Elvis impersonator, loves to party and stay out dancing on tables Far from being embarrassed by their party pensioner grandparent, Pat's family think she's great fun and love it if she joins them on nights out. Her granddaughter, Paris, 20, said: 'She stays out till 1am dancing on the tables, it's not embarrassing, I don't think my nanna shouldn't do that, it's cool.' Pat isn't alone in her desire to party. She has a partner in crime in her friend Julia Church, 67, who now lives in Menorca. Julia, also a retired hairdresser, moved to the Spanish island with her husband and now parties with her fellow British expats following his death seven years ago. Pat regularly visits her and the pair get glammed up for nights out where they drink and dance the night away. Pat on a night out with Julia, left, who says 'we'll just keep going till we fall to bits' The friends often party all night in Menorca where Julia now lives Julia said: 'You can't judge others like us, we're not normal, we're crazy. Being 67 or 27 it doesn't make any difference, we're exactly the same. 'I don't like the thought of getting old, we'll just keep going till we fall to bits. There's no point worrying about it, you'll make yourself depressed.' Pat has been single for years following the death of her husband and said she has dated some younger men - including a man in his 40s who was younger than her 49-year-old son. But now she's found happiness with Colin, 66. She said: 'We have a fantastic time together, we have good sex, we enjoy each others' company.

But the fling turned into a nightmare after she found herself falsely accused of trying to extort \u00a3100,000 from the footballer. Sarah Watson, who was falsely accused of blackmailing premier league star Marcus Rojo, has been snapped with a suspicious white powder Ms Watson is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of the unknown white powder on the glass table The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her. Last month a judge  ruled the player had tried to buy her off to keep his cheating secret from his partner, and Rojo was ordered to pay her \u00a325,000 legal costs. 'I just wish I'd never got involved with the likes of them,' she said after the court case. 'This has been a total nightmare. Now pictures have emerged which appear to reveal Ms Watson's party girl lifestyle. In one, she is seen using a driving licence to cut up lines of an unknown white power in Las Vegas. In another, she is pictured with a kingsize roll-up while in one, a scantily clad Ms Watson is seen making a V-sign as she poses on the bonnet of a police car. A close friend told the Mirror that single Ms Watson was a regular at trendy spots\u00a0San Carlo and Neighbourhood in Manchester. The High Court has since overturned a gagging order against Ms Watson who claims Rojo (left) and his representatives were behind a plot to frame her It was a last-minute decision to go for a 'girls' night out' with six friends in December last year that landed Sarah in her gruelling legal fight. The 34-year-old had met Rojo at Manchester United's private Christmas party in a Manchester bar. She said the footballer had approached her and complimented her looks and dress.\u00a0Despite calling his approach 'cheesy', she had decided to give him her phone number. Later that evening\u00a0Rojo invited her to his friend's flat for a more private party, but she declined and they parted. He then sent a text at 2am. 'My love, where are you?' he asked. 'It was a bit of an ego boost for me. There were a lot of young, pretty girls that night, but he wanted me.' So she and a girlfriend booked a taxi to the address he sent her. When they arrived at the flat in the centre of the city, a friend of Rojo's \u2013 known in court as Mr X but who now can be named as Kristian Bereit \u2013 made a shocking proposition. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed 'He asked me how much it would cost for me to have sex with Marcos. I told him that I was not a prostitute.' But she did find the Argentine star's dusky looks attractive and they ended up in a bedroom. 'I did it because I liked him, not for money or with any intention to sell the story on,' she said. She had been shocked when he started bombarding her with astonishingly explicit messages and naked photos. But she rapidly found herself pitched against the might of the football club, the spoiled multi- millionaire player and lawyers who act for several Manchester United stars who went to extreme lengths to keep the story out of the papers. She was depicted in court \u2013 and in the national press \u2013 as a scheming blackmailer who demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about the affair. Rojo's identity in the court case was originally held back as a 'Premier League footballer' though the details have now been revealed. Rojo's wife, Eugenia Lusardo (pictured with Rojo last month) is a lingerie model And it was on this basis that the player's lawyers obtained a High Court order preventing her from speaking out. \u2018People who look after Marcos claimed I had demanded \u00a3100,000 to keep quiet about our encounter,\u2019 she said.. \u2018But it was a lie and they knew it. They tried to trap me.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t set out to do a kiss and tell, but the chance to make some money to pay for my personal training course was very tempting. I\u2019m a single woman and I had not done anything illegal or that I was ashamed of. '[Rojo] and his people contrived to make me look like a greedy cow, when it was them who offered me \u00a3100,000 as hush money.' Last month Mr Justice Warby made a ruling in the High Court that overturned the gagging order and ordered Rojo to pay Sarah's estimated \u00a325,000 legal costs.

Both clubs have a history of fan trouble but Leeds have not confirmed whether the decision for such a low number of tickets was down to the club, council or police, when they would usually offer in excess of 2,500 tickets to away fans. And now Cardiff have thrown their support behind a fan-run campaign to boycott the trip to Elland Road by handing back their tickets 'as a matter of principle'. Cardiff City will have no supporters present at Saturday's Championship game against Leeds United The club, including CEO Ken Choo (far left) have thrown their backing behind a fans' boycott of the game Cardiff welcomed 2,200 Leeds fans to the Cardiff City Stadium in the reverse fixture back in November's game, which ended a 3-1 win for the home side, and have been angered by the decision not to reciprocate. Leeds have not spoken on the matter but it is believed that they offered 2,000 tickets with restrictions on those travelling to Yorkshire before offering an allocation of 500 without restrictions. Supporters groups had already spoken about boycotting the game and now a full shut-out of away fans has been confirmed by the news that Cardiff will not take up any of their seats at Elland Road. Elland Road will be without any away fans on Saturday for the 3pm kick-off after Cardiff sent back the tickets The reverse fixture earlier in the season at the Cardiff City Stadium saw Leeds fans offered 2,200 tickets 'Our preference was for Cardiff City fans to be granted the same respect and freedom of travel as provided to over 2,000 Leeds supporters for the corresponding fixture this season, and we are frustrated that this could not be permitted,' Cardiff CEO Ken Choo said in a statement. 'With the intelligence and information available however, we consider the event to be routine and manageable and that that the travel and ticket restrictions in place are substantially out of proportion to any perceived risk. 'As stated by our Supporter Groups, we also believe that West Yorkshire Police could manage the event without issue or restrictions, if they chose to do so.' Choo said the club would have preferred for their fans to be treated with 'respect and freedom' as Leeds were Leeds fans will not have any opposition to sing against for the Championship clash on Saturday afternoon West Yorkshire Police were criticised by Millwall manager Ian Holloway earlier this year for their treatment of his club's supporters after they were offered an allocation of just 200 restricted tickets. WYP are yet to comment on Cardiff's statement. Leeds have also rejected Cardiff's request to hold a 'beam back' at the Cardiff City Stadium, with the 3pm kick-off being shown at the away side's ground in Wales, a decision that Khoo says has left his club frustrated. 'For the game on Saturday we are frustrated at not being able to support our players in what we consider to be fair numbers and also question the rationale in denying our request to show the fixture via beam back at Cardiff City Stadium,' he added. Alex Mowatt of Leeds celebrates after scoring against Wolverhampton Wanderers on Easter Monday Alex Revell of Cardiff in action against Bolton Wanderers at the Cardiff City Stadium on Monday 'Doing so would at least allow our supporters to experience the match, albeit to a lesser degree than preferred.'

Or more likely Greece simply looks like a wonderful place to take the kids compared with resorts closer to territory controlled by the so-called Islamic State.But why aren't the Greeks manning the barricades in protest against already-announced, painful VAT increases and pension cuts, and in anticipation of swingeing reductions in farm subsidies, controversial privatisations and the opening of professions and industries to the harsh wind of competition?Well it may be the calm before the revelation later this week of just how much Alexis Tsipras has conceded to obtain \u00e2\u201a\u00ac86bn of new credit from the eurozone and (well maybe) the IMF, in the third bailout of this cripplingly indebted country.Surely at the very least Greek citizens will be curious to learn why Mr Tsipras is rushing to agree terms that he and his colleagues eschewed when elected at the turn of the year.Presumably the explanation is that Greece's near-death experience in July - the closure of banks and the collapse of economic activity - turned Syriza into disciples of TINA (there is no alternative).What is striking of course is that Tsipras remains remarkably popular, in spite of conspicuously failing to deliver an end to fiscal (tax and spending) austerity.Worse, his standoff with the rest of the eurozone has saddled Greece with monetary austerity too: the continued partial closure of the banks mean they have no money to lend.Not that many Greek companies have the confidence to ask for a loan for investment, but if retailers and wholesalers can't get adequate credit to obtain credit from abroad, Christmas will be cancelled (70% of shops' orders are placed in September and October, bankers tell me).There is the vice, in both senses of the word. Greece is suffering from a vicious economic squeeze, which will undoubtedly further impoverish Greek people.So for all the relief throughout the eurozone that Syriza has finally been battered into submission, the new bailout will only hold if Tsipras can offer hope of better times ahead.Many would say that good economics and politics requires creditors to ease the burden of Greece's unsustainably large debts by between a third and a half.So if this new bailout deal is to be that extraordinary thing, a path to genuine recovery, Brussels and - especially - Berlin will need to avoid triumphalism and manifest debt forgiveness in the face of Athens' capitulation.", "reference": "i have n\\'t been in greece for three weeks but i am told it is eerily quiet and-in respect of tourism-surprisingly busy.", "sentences": ["more than two million greek banks have been affected by the collapse of the international monetary fund ( imf ) this week."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}}, "llm_output": "[{\"sentence\": \"more than two million greek banks have been affected by the collapse of the international monetary fund ( imf ) this week.\", \"reason\": \"The transcript never mentions any number of Greek banks, nor does it report a collapse of the IMF or effects on banks this week; these claims are wholly absent from the source.\", \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"}]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

The idea of having another referendum on Scotland's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters. It comes after Scottish First Minister  Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections. Scroll down for video Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was campaigning in Aberdeen today ahead of a second TV debate tonight When questioned on the issue in last night's Scottish leaders TV debate, Ms Sturgeon insisted an SNP victory in the General Election would not trigger another referendum. But she added it was 'another matter' whether a vote for her party in the 2016 Holyrood elections would bring about a second vote on independence. Ms Sturgeon has also vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe. But a poll by Ipsos Mori for BBC Scotland reveals that a referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union was more popular with voters north of the border than another independence ballot. More than 1,000 adults were questioned for the research, with pollsters asking them to give various issues a score of between one and 10, depending on how important these were to them. A score of one meant a policy should not be implemented while 10 was taken to mean it should be put into action immediately. In last night's TV showdown with the Scottish leaders of Labour, the Tories and Lib Dems, Mr Sturgeon refused to rule out a second independence vote before 2020 Ms Sturgeon has\u00a0 vehemently criticised David Cameron's pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe The most popular policy was increasing the minimum wage for those aged over 21, which was given a score of 8.2. Giving the Scottish Parliament power over all welfare benefits was eighth most popular, with a score of 7.1, while transferring full responsibility for income tax to Holyrood came 10th on the list at 6.8. Holding another independence referendum by 2020 was given a score of 5.6, compared to 6.1 for a referendum on remaining in the EU. Scottish National Party election campaign director Angus Robertson insisted the poll showed support for his party's main policies. He said: 'This is a very welcome poll - it demonstrates that the people of Scotland share our view that the Westminster parties are not delivering on their referendum vow, and want far more power for Scotland. 'Electing a strong team of SNP MPs in May is the only way to ensure that Scotland gets the power we need to build social justice and economic prosperity.' Scotland's political leaders, from left to right, Tory Ruth Davidson, Labour's Jim Murphy, the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie faced off in a live TV election debate last night Overall, Scots prefer more public spending ahead of paying off the deficit \u2013 but also favour the Government's welfare cap. However, there is also widespread support for a Mansion Tax and an increase in the top rate of income tax to 50p. Mark Diffley, Director, Ipsos MORI Scotland said: 'The poll gives a clear steer about where the economic priorities for voters in Scotland lie. 'Broadly, Scots want to see measures to improve the standard of living, particularly a higher minimum wage, rises in pensions and lower energy bills. 'There is also a preference for higher targeted public spending even if that means the deficit is not eliminated in the next five years and targeted tax increases for those with the greatest income and wealth.'", "reference": "another independence vote ranks 19th on list of 23 policies for scots . comes after nicola sturgeon refused to rule out staging a second vote . snp leader has also attacked the tory pledge to hold an eu referendum . but ipsos mori poll reveals scots prefer a say on brussels to independence .", "sentences": ["Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote , a new survey has revealed .", "Idea of having another referendum on Scotland 's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters .", "Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 1, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "GramE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Scottish voters would rather have a referendum on the EU than another independence vote , a new survey has revealed .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that a referendum on EU membership was more popular with Scottish voters than another independence referendum, matching the summary statement.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Idea of having another referendum on Scotland 's future in the UK before 2020 was ranked 19th on a list of 23 policies presented to voters .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly notes that this policy was ranked 19th of 23, so the summary sentence is accurate.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon last night refused to rule out staging a second independence vote if the SNP wins the 2016 Holyrood elections .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript reports that Ms. Sturgeon would not rule out a second referendum should the SNP win in 2016, matching the summary sentence.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

What exactly is service of process? Serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle: if you are going to sue someone, you should at least let them know about it. Sounds simple, right?  In theory it is.  In practice, it turns out people don't like being sued.  It also turns out that, to many defendants, procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense. Just as you may avoid bad news in life, defendants tend to avoid process servers.  Once a defendant has been served, that means the judicial proceedings begin.  Unfortunately, that means defendants have an incentive to go off the grid. Although every state is different, the law of service of process has evolved this way: the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person, and have some proof that the person was the defendant. In-person service is not always possible, for obvious reasons.  So, the law had to develop methods of alternate service, but carefully balance a defendant's right to have notice of a lawsuit, against a diligent plaintiff's access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable. As reliable as the U.S. mail is, regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers.  Not because the postmen can't be trusted; they can. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, will keep them from delivering those papers.  Instead, it's defendants -- no wait, all of humanity -- that can't be trusted.  Every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we didn't get it.  Defendants are no different. One form of alternate service is nail and mail service.  This means that you take a hammer and nail, and nail the papers to the defendant's front door.  The problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature.  Just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at, doesn't mean he'll be back there anytime soon. Another, even odder form of service is service by publication.  This is an almost laughable legal fiction.  If you can't find a defendant, a judge might let you serve by publication.  That means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication, on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the Secaucus Law Journal looking for lawsuits against you.  As laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds, it's at least more rational than this antiquated method. At first blush, the idea of service by Facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him.  When it comes to serving papers, however, traditional doesn't necessarily mean good.  Service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable; it's just service of last resort. For those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a Facebook announcement in a news feed, along with the photos of dinner or kittens, to be liked by all your gawking friends, we're not quite there ... yet. While the older forms of alternate service were public, most electronic service takes the form of email.  Where email isn't available, it is Facebook private messaging, which should be as private as email.  That's the form of service authorized by the court here.  So for now, we're not quite putting lawsuits on Instagram ... but I wouldn't rule it out in the future. Online service may be a new frontier, but it's not unheard of. Most of us exist more online now than we live in a particular condo, or Mom's basement. Virtually everyone has a phone or access to the Internet.  Not everyone has a lease or a mortgage.  Plus, online service has the added benefit of tracking.  Believe me, somewhere, some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article, how long you read it, and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article (thanks for still being here, by the way).  In a way, maybe online service is long overdue.  You can outrun a process server for a while, but sooner or later, all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email.", "reference": "a court allowed a wife to serve divorce papers via facebook . danny cevallos : why not let people be found via social media ? .", "sentences": ["a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook .", "serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript explicitly states that a New York judge authorized serving divorce papers via Facebook, matching the summary exactly.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that serving legal papers constitutes an industry and body of law based on a guiding principle, aligning with the summary sentence.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error"]}

Glenn Mason, 56, plundered the accounts of nine pensioners including an 83 year-old woman and a 92 year-old man living near his branch in Biggin Hill, Kent, the Old Bailey heard. Mason, who was given an award by the Metropolitan Police in Bromley in 2009 for his crime fighting efforts, got away with the thefts for almost a year before his arrest in July 2012. His attempts to cover up his crime by transferring money using the identity of two of his colleagues, Julie Jeffrey, 50, and James Cato, 35, led to them being sacked and charged with fraud. It was only when Mason pleaded guilty in September that the case against them was dropped at the Old Bailey. Mason, who was jailed for 15 months in November last year, has said he will pay back the whole \u00a3185,000 out of his RBS pension pot. The bank has already refunded the customers targeted by Mason, and will receive the money as compensation. \u2018The benefit was \u00a3185,000 and the recoverable amount is greater than that so the available amount will be the same\u2019, said prosecutor David Hughes. \u2018The loser here ultimately was RBS - they had to reimburse the account holders.\u2019 Mr Hughes said the bank had started civil proceedings against Mason, as well as the compensation claim that comes after a criminal conviction. \u2018If he makes a payment from his pension pot to RBS then that would deal with these proceedings and they would come to an end.\u2019 Mason, who sobbed in the dock as he was jailed, did not appear in court for today\u2019s hearing. Judge Stephen Kramer QC will confirm the money has been paid at a short hearing on May 15. At his sentencing hearing, Andrew Lawson, representing Mason, said the bank manager turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting with British troops in Afghanistan. Mr Lawson said that all of the stolen money was paid into his gambling account and told the court: \u2018It was late night poker and online games that are designed to tempt you into spending money in the hope of a big win.\u2019 The court also heard statements from two of Mason\u2019s victims, Julie Amos and Leslie Pilditch, who both said they no longer felt able to trust banks. Julie Jeffrey also described how she lost her job after her arrest and added: \u2018I no longer feel proud, my life has fallen apart.\u2019 Mason's actions took place at Natwest in Biggin Hill (pictured). The bank manager was said to have turned to gambling after his teenage son was injured by a roadside bomb while fighting  in Afghanistan Elaine May, the current manager of the NatWest Biggin Hill branch, also said in a statement that the thefts had \u2018an ongoing impact within the community\u2019 and put strain upon the staff. Mason continues to live in the area with his wife and son and has been working in a local newsagents. The judge, Mr Recorder Simon Farrell QC, told him: \u2018You stole roughly \u00a3185,000 over a period of a year from nine victims who were all elderly and undoubtedly vulnerable. \u2018Your fellow worker Julie Jeffrey, who was falsely arrested because you used her ID details to steal the money, described how, having worked for NatWest since the age of 16, losing her job as a 50 year-old woman and being reduced to delivery leaflets in all weathers. \u2018Plainly these are very serious offences which everyone agrees cross the custody threshold. \u2018You are of previous good character and someone who has suffered considerable personal tragedy. \u2018Your wife suffered from cancer in 2005 and your son at only 19 went to Afghanistan to fight for his country and was the victim of an improvised explosive device that caused him very serious injury. \u2018I accept this caused you to develop a serious gambling addiction which was in fact the root cause of stealing the money from customers. \u2018In my judgement I am afraid these matters are so serious that I am not able to suspend the sentence. The best I can do is to pass a sentence of 15 months imprisonment. But for your personal mitigation this sentence would have been far longer.\u2019 Mason, of Flamborough Close, Biggin Hill, pleaded guilty to a single charge of fraud.

Here, Sportsmail recounts 10 of his finest moments from his broadcasting career. Richie Benaud, one of cricket's great personalities, has died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer 1. BALL OF THE CENTURY Benaud was on hand to talk viewers through Shane Warne's first test delivery for Australia in England in the 1993 Ashes, which turned out to be a stunning dismissal of Mike Gatting. 2. AUSTRALIA'S UNDERARM BALL Benaud was renowned for his calming tone as broadcaster but his pure disdain for Trevor Chappell's underarm delivery for Australia against New Zealand in 1981 is equally as memorable. 'One of the worst things I have ever seen done on a cricket field,' he raged from the Channel Nine studio. 3. LAST SPELL OF COMMENTARY IN ENGLAND Benaud's final commentary duties for Channel 4 came in the fifth Ashes Test at The Oval in 2005 and was commemorated by members of the crowd waving banners in tribute. 4. 'YOU'VE GOT TO CHECK IF THEY'RE STILL THERE!' Benaud's  cricketing knowledge was matched with sharp turn of humour, an example being when he saw a player get hit by a cricket ball in a place no man wishes to get hit. 5. ANDREW SYMONDS STOPS A STREAKER Thankfully, Benaud was on hand to embellish one of cricket's more bizarre moments during a one-day international between Australia and India. 6. TRIBUTE TO PHILLIP HUGHES Benaud narrated Channel Nine's powerful tribute to Phillip Hughes in November 2014. 7. GEOFFREY BOYCOTT RUNS OUT DEREK RANDALL Now a commentator himself, one can only imagine the uproar if Geoffrey Boycott saw a modern day player run his batting partner out in the reckless manner he did to Derek Randall. But Benaud's take was typically measured. 8. BENAUD COMPARES DON BRADMAN WITH SACHIN TENDULKAR Benaud's fascinating dissection of Sachin Tendulkar's capabilities compared to Don Bradman show not only what an encyclopedic knowledge of cricket he possessed, but also how his understanding of the game evolved alongside the sport itself. 9. BENAUD ON BOTHAM Sir Ian Botham's ferocious unbeaten 149 for England in the 3rd Test of the 1981 Ashes at Headingly had Benaud unleashing some of his best lines. 10. INTRODUCING 'AUSTRALIA'S BIGGEST SUMMER OF CRICKET EVER' One of Benaud's final pieces of work saw him introduce Australia's cricketing summer of 2014, where he looked ahead to his home country co-hosting the World Cup. His enthusiasm is vibrant and infectious, with his voice galvanised by excitement. P.S... HE COULD PLAY, TOO! Benaud excelled as a broadcaster and his voice will always conjure memories of cricket's greatest moments but before embarking on a media career, he was a magnificent player. He captained Australia during their domination of the game during the late 1950's, spearheading their success with a flamboyant, forward-thinking style of leadership. He was the first man to score over 2,000 runs and take more than 200 wickets in Tests and one of his finest dismissals came against England in 1958.", "reference": "richie benaud died at the age of 84 after battling skin cancer . his commentary style is considered synonymous with cricket . sportsmail recalls 10 of his best moments in the commentary box . read : when richie benaud welcomed viewers , they were able to relax . click here for richie benaud tributes as cricket world mourns legend .", "sentences": ["richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .", "benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's first test delivery for australia in the 1993 ashes .", "benaud has died at age 84 for battling skin cancer ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "LinkE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 1], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "LinkE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"richie benaud has passed away at the age of 84 after a short battle with skin cancer .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Accurately reflects the transcript statement about Benaud\u2019s death, age, and cause.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"benaud was on hand to talk viewers through shane warne 's first test delivery for australia in the 1993 ashes .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Matches the transcript\u2019s description of Benaud commenting on Shane Warne\u2019s first Test ball in the 1993 Ashes.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"benaud has died at age 84 for battling skin cancer .\",\n    \"reason\": \"Conveys the same facts (Benaud died at 84 after battling skin cancer); slight wording issue does not change factuality.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error"]}

I guess we'll have to put up with their telephone reminders.Elena and her husband owe well over 1m roubles (about \u00a310,800; $17,000) to those four banks.After the cash piles are sorted the family of three is left with only 10,000 roubles (\u00a3107; $167). That puts them below the poverty line - and recently Elena lost her job.Millions of those in debt live like Elena.According to the Russian United Credit Bureau (UCB), 40 million Russians have loans or mortgages.By June, 12.5m of those loans had not been paid for at least a month, and in another 8m cases the arrears stretched back over three months.The Russian Central Bank says total personal debt has risen to 1tn roubles (\u00a310.7bn; $16.7bn). At least 10% of that amount cannot be recovered by the banks.For Elena and her husband, this is a story of almost two decades of borrowing. They started getting loans in the mid-1990s to pay for their daughter's medical treatment. Then they took a bigger loan to pay off the smaller ones.It all seemed manageable, says Elena, but then new expenses came along - and two banks offered credit cards with generous conditions.We were a bit stupid, Elena says. They told us the minimum payment was 5,000 roubles a month and we paid that every month. But that was just the interest, not the loan itself.During Russia's boom years credit history checks meant virtually nothing. An individual already saddled with loans could take out another one, hoping to pay off previous debts. The small print was often too small to bother about.Then the music stopped. Money got tight after the 2008 global financial crisis and Western sanctions against Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict.The average personal loan in 2014 was 54,600 roubles.Olga Mazurova is head of Sentinel Credit Management, one of Russia's largest debt-collecting agencies. She says that often Russians are hit by a sudden drop in income, because the firm goes bankrupt, the working week is cut, there are layoffs or wage cuts - we see that especially in industrial cities in Siberia and the Urals. Few Russians have insurance for such contingencies, she says.Debtors cannot get much help. There are plans to amend the law on insolvency, to allow individuals to be declared bankrupt. But nothing will happen on that until October.Russian MPs decided that criminal courts were unprepared for the likely flood of such cases and that courts of arbitration should handle debt cases instead.Each debtor has to beg the bank to cut them some slack. But Russia's financial ombudsman Pavel Medvedev says that rarely works if someone owes money to more than one institution.A former adviser to President Vladimir Putin, he knows many top Russian financiers personally - but that does not help him to lobby on behalf of indebted callers. Typically, he says, lenders refuse to restructure personal debts with the words: I've got a business to run and shareholders demand profits - I can't do it!Mr Medvedev says his success rate in helping debtors has dropped from 51% to 33% and this year it's probably going to be around 16%.He had no solution for one caller, Vladimir Frolov, living near Moscow.Mr Frolov started borrowing four years ago to help his partner, living separately from him, in Ukraine. The debts snowballed. Finally, unable to get an unsecured loan, he mortgaged the flat he shares with his elderly parents.His father Anatoly, who co-signed the agreement, is bewildered when asked which bank it was. How should I know? They took us into some room, the light was dim and the print was tiny. I just asked if everything was alright and they told me it was.Besides the mortgage, Vladimir Frolov's parents took out two loans to help him, which eat up 18,000 of their 22,000-rouble monthly pension allowance.And now Vladimir has defaulted on the mortgage.

If I had known, I could have rationalised it but at the time I felt embarrassed.I started thinking 'maybe it is me, maybe I'm doing something wrong.'On Monday, the watchdog published 21 reports into schools allegedly targeted as part of a hardline Muslim takeover.Five of those schools, including Park View and Oldknow, were rated inadequate.'Islamic-themed assemblies'Birmingham City Council said it would work with Saltley School, the only local authority school placed in special measures, and the Department for Education to install a temporary governing board.In a letter to Park View chairman Tahir Alam, education minister Lord Nash said there were deep concerns about the way Park View School was run.The letter said: I have decided under clause 5.6 of the supplementary funding agreement for the academy to give written notice of the Secretary of State's intention to terminate that agreement.Lord Nash criticised the trust for failing to promote spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of pupils.I am deeply mindful of the need to eliminate discrimination, advance equality of opportunity and foster good relations, he said.A similar letter about Nansen Primary School, also addressed to Tahir Alam, said it would have its funding arrangement terminated.Both letters invited the trust to respond before 4 July.A spokesman for Park View School said they would challenge the Ofsted report through the appropriate legal channels.They said terminating the funding agreement would mean the trust could be removed from the running of the three schools.What happens to the schools after that would be the decision of the secretary of state, as they are already academy schools under the remit of [the] Department for Education, they said.In a letter to Dr Achmad da Costa, chair of Oldknow Academy Trust, Lord Nash said it was not meeting the requirements set out in its funding agreement.Therefore the Secretary of State is minded to terminate the funding agreement unless all the breaches are addressed promptly, in full, and to his satisfaction, it said.Lord Nash set out a list of actions the trust must take before 4 July.These included ending less favourable treatment of non-Muslims, ceasing segregation of boys and girls, and drawing up a plan to ensure a more broad and balanced curriculum.Oldknow Academy declined to comment on the letter from Lord Nash.A letter to Tahir Alam regarding Golden Hillock's funding arrangement set out a similar list of demands to be completed within the same timescale.Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw said a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip in Birmingham schools, while a number of head teachers had reported an organised campaign to target certain schools in order to impose a narrow, faith-based ideology.'Own agendas'The report into Park View School said the academy's work to keep students safe, including from extremism, was inadequate.It said external speakers had not been vetted properly and the school had allowed a guest with known extremist views to speak to students as part of Islamic-themed assemblies.Park View and Oldknow trusts did not comment on the future but one of Saltley School's senior teachers said it hoped to boost its Ofsted rating.Darren Turner was brought in as associate head teacher on Thursday as part of a partnership scheme with other local schools.He said there had been upset among staff and pupils at Saltley's inadequate rating.This is all about moving forward, what happens next, he said.Behind these walls they've got some excellent teachers and they want to get back to doing what they are good at: teaching.When this school gets back to 'good' again we want to go further and become outstanding.Parents at the schools have criticised Ofsted's reports and accused inspectors of bias.Health professional Arshad Malik told the BBC the findings were  alien to his child's experience at Park View.\u200eInspectors came with loaded questions, he said.People are

Some complained that Summerbee's send-off had gone on for too long and was responsible for their late arrival.

Lizzi Crawford, 32, tipped the scales at 20 stone when she overheard the young bus passenger ask his mum: 'Has she got a baby in her belly?' The embarrassing remark left the mother-of-six, from Stoke-on-Trent, mortified but inspired her to ditch her unhealthy lifestyle and shed the pounds, slimming down to a healthier 12.5st. Lizzi Crawford dropped over 7st after a stranger mistook her for being pregnant Lizzi had reached a size 24 dress after living on a diet of burgers, pizzas and kebabs. But she also devoured liquid calories in the form of wine and spirits. However Lizzi never realised how big she had got until she heard the pregnancy remark on the bus. She said: 'It started when I was taking my kids to school and we were sitting on the bus. A kid then looked at me and said: Has she got a baby in her belly?' Lizzi now admits that she was living an extremely unhealthy lifestyle. She continued: 'It was terrible. I was being a slob to be honest. Lizzi piled on the pounds thanks to a boozy lifestyle and diet of takeaways, pizzas and kebabs As well as her battle to lose weight Lizzi also won her battle against cervical cancer 'I was eating burgers, takeaways, pizzas, kebabs and drinking - mainly wine and spirits mixed with Dr Pepper. 'I knew I had to do something about my weight for the sake of my children.' In a serious bid to slim down Lizzi began cooking healthier meals and joining fitness and self-defense classes which saw her lose over 7st. Incredibly, she achieved her goal despite suffering the set-back of being diagnosed with cervical cancer in October 2012. As well as winning her fight against the disease following a hysterectomy and cancer treatment she has now won her battle against the bulge. Lizzi, who works a cleaner, kept fit by attending self-defense classes at T6 Fight Club in Burslem, Stoke-on-Trent. She also discovered Hourglass training - a fitness programme designed to keep a woman's curves while she gets healthy. Lizzi says that having support from other women at her gym helped her to achieve her goal. Lizzi joined the gym and began hourglass training and says that she is now addicted to fitness 'I began to build relationships with the people at the gym. The girls were egging me on to eat well - they all cheer each other on. 'I've got some of the best friends I've ever made there. They don't look down their noses at you and you're always made to feel welcome.' The slimmer says she is now 'addicted' to her fitness classes and goes five times every week. She added that losing the weight has helped her mental being as well as her physical being. 'I can do a lot more things now. I can walk more places and do more with the kids - I can even do simple tasks like getting up and down the stairs easier now. 'It's helped me mentally because it was depressing when I was heavy, but since I started Hourglass, that has just gone. 'The weight loss has helped me in the workplace too. I find I can get around much quicker and finish earlier - it used to take me ages. 'Now I can spend more time with the kids.' Lizzi's mum, Mary Crawford, 57, said her daughter's slimming efforts had been 'amazing'. She added: 'She's found out about cooking the right way, she's been going to the gym and riding bikes. 'She's stuck at it and I think it's amazing what she's done. I'm really pleased, and I believe she will keep it off as she's found a routine that suits her.

The $40 billion taxi service has been plagued by serious accusations of failing to vet its drivers. Lawsuits have been brought against Uber in San Francisco and Los Angeles. A New Delhi driver was accused of raping a passenger in December. This week in Denver, a driver tried and failed to break into a passenger's home. And in London, a woman was allegedly asked to perform oral sex on her driver. These claims, among others, follow a data leak last May, which saw the details of 50,000 current and former drivers released into the public domain. It is hoped Sullivan, the first federal prosecutor to specialize in high-technology crime, can protect Uber from potentially crippling ramifications. Lifeline? Joe Sullivan, 46, will leave his role as Facebook's security chief to help Uber defend safety concerns There were three high-profile assault cases involving Uber drivers in December 2014. An Indian woman said her driver raped her in New Delhi, leading to outcries and a temporary ban of Uber in that city. It came days after a driver was charged in Boston with raping a young woman. The same week, a woman in London revealed that she was offered \u00a320 credit from Uber after one of its drivers allegedly sexually harassed her during a cab ride. This week in Denver an UberX driver was arrested after he dropped a passenger off at the airport before allegedly driving back to her house, and trying to break in. The cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles are both suing the company for 'misleading the public' by failing to conduct thorough backgrounds checks. The firm's first security chief, he brings with him an extensive portfolio of experience in cyber security and privacy. He spent two decades tackling cyber crime security in the private and public sector before joining the Justice Department. Cases included child protection, bank privacy, and digital strands of 9/11 investigations. Since, he has headed up the security departments at eBay, PayPal, and Facebook. Though his experience lies in digital protection, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick has also entrusted the 46-year-old with tackling physical security. Sullivan's role will involve liaising with city and state governments around the world as the firm rapidly expands. Announcing the hire in a blog post\u00a0on Thursday Kalanick wrote: 'We are both in cyberspace and on city streets all at once; a bridge between bits and atoms. 'And as we get into tens of millions of rides a week, we continue to challenge ourselves to do even better when it comes to safety and data security.'

The complaint was made by Nigalidze's opponent in their sixth-round match in the tournament, Armenia's Tigran Petrosian. He said: 'Nigalidze would promptly reply to my moves and then literally run to the toilet. 'I noticed that he would always visit the same toilet partition, which was strange, since two other partitions weren't occupied. 'I informed the chief arbiter about my growing suspicions and asked him to keep an eye on Gaioz. 'After my opponent left the very toilet partition yet another time, the arbiters entered it. 'What they found was the mobile phone with headphones; the device was hidden behind the pan and covered with toilet paper.' Tournament organisers at the Dubai Open Chess tournament\u00a0announced their decision to expel Nigalidze on Sunday morning on their Facebook page When officials confronted the Georgian, he denied owning the device but officials found the phone was logged into a social networking site under his name. They also found his match being analysed in one of the chess applications. He was promptly removed from the tournament and could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game. When questioned about the offence,\u00a0Nigalidze said: 'Not everything is true in what Petrosian said'. This is not the first time a player was caught cheating at a chess tournament. In July 2013, Bulgarian player Borislav Ivanov was suspended from playing for four months by his national federation. It had been found most of his moves matched those of the leading computer chess analysis programs. Two years earlier the French chess federation suspended three players, including the national team captain, when it was alleged they used text messages, a remote chess computer and coded signals to beat the opposition at the 2010 Chess Olympiad. In 2008, at the Dubai Open, an Iranian player was banned when he was found to be receiving help from someone watching the game's live broadcast on the internet and was sending the moves through text messages. Tournaments sanctioned by the International Chess Federation - including the Dubai Open - do not allow players to carry mobile phones and other electronic devices during matches.", "reference": "gaioz nigalidze has been expelled from the dubai open chess tournament . georgian champion was found using his phone in the middle of a match . opponent grew suspicious when he kept making trips to the toilet . tournament organisers then saw he had wrapped a phone in toilet paper . found his match was being monitored in a chess application on the phone .", "sentences": ["Gaioz Nigalidze , the current Georgian champion , was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament .", "He was found using his smartphone in the middle of a match .", "Tournament organisers found the phone in a cubicle , covered in toilet paper .", "He could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Gaioz Nigalidze , the current Georgian champion , was expelled from the Dubai Open Chess tournament .\",\n    \"reason\": \"This statement is explicitly stated in the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"He was found using his smartphone in the middle of a match .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript confirms that he was caught using his smartphone during play.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"Tournament organisers found the phone in a cubicle , covered in toilet paper .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states the phone was hidden in a cubicle and covered with toilet paper.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"He could now face a maximum 15-year ban from the game .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states he could face up to a 15-year ban.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

It's one where people think if you set up just to cling on to that point it can often be the downfall of teams.That won't be our approach, but it is one where we want to make sure we are more in control of how we go about our performance.Performing well is first and foremost what we want to do, because we know when the focus is on doing that then the results come with it.Wales assistant boss Osian Roberts confirmed Wales have a fully-fit squad to choose from for the Russia game.Pick the XI that you think can take Wales far at Euro 2016 - and then share it with your friends using our team selector.", "reference": "wales boss chris coleman says euro 2016 is ``not the end of the journey\\'\\'for his squad as they prepare to face russia for a place in the last 16.", "sentences": ["wales manager chris coleman says his side\\'s euro 2016 qualifier against france at euro 2016 will be a ``friendly\\'\\'."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["LinkE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"wales manager chris coleman says his side's euro 2016 qualifier against france at euro 2016 will be a ``friendly''.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript never mentions Wales playing France, never calls any Euro 2016 match a \\\"friendly,\\\" and does not describe the Russia game (or any other) as a qualifier; thus both the opponent (France) and the claim that Coleman labelled it a friendly are unsupported.\",\n    \"category\": \"out-of-context error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["out-of-context error"]}

The 2005 Ashes winning captain is the hot favourite on the three-man shortlist compiled by the ECB at Thursday\u2019s management board meeting ahead of Andrew Strauss and Alec Stewart, who have both registered their interest. Vaughan spoke with new ECB chief executive Tom Harrison for an hour and has worked closely in the past with chairman-elect Colin Graves at Yorkshire and looks set to be offered the job if he can reach agreement. Michael Vaughan has emerged as the favourite for the newly created role of director of England cricket Vaughan spoke to the ECB about the role on Thursday after emerging as the No 1 choice Alec Stewart, who is also in the frame, stands at the KIA Oval ahead of a Surrey team photo shoot on Thursday \u2018I had a good chat with Tom which was just about general stuff,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018We had a one-hour conversation. I have not got a clue what the role is, what the parameters are or what they are looking for. \u2018It was the first time I have met him since he was made chief executive because I\u2019ve been away at the World Cup. I knew him from his IMG days and back in the day when he played for Derbyshire but we had not met in person for a long time,\u2019 Vaughan told the Daily Telegraph. \u2018It was just a chance to meet up and have a chat and try to kick around a few ideas. It was away from England stuff. It was about the game, the structure and Twenty20. Everything. \u2018I like the way he works and his vision for the game and he and Colin Graves will be the perfect partnership. But nothing has changed as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am keen to talk to them when I understand more about the role and what skills are required. 'There will be many others, really good guys, keen to talk who are the type of guys needed to move English cricket forward. \u2018I am certainly not in a position to be anywhere near being appointed because I don\u2019t know what the job is. Until we know what it entails I, like all the other candidates, have to look at it and see whether it is for me.\u2019 Former England stars Vaughan and Stewart both work in the media as cricket analysts and commentators Andrew Strauss is another former England captain who is being considered for the role That may be so but the ECB are keen to make a quick appointment and Vaughan looks certain to be the one they want to effectively become a football manager type figure with overall responsibility for coaching and selection. Peter Moores, who is preparing to coach England in their Test series here in the Caribbean, said on Thursday he could work with Vaughan even though the pair had an uneasy relationship when they were captain and coach in 2007. Vaughan has also been a strong critic of Moores in his second coming as coach in his various media roles and it is the amount of successful interests Vaughan has that remain the biggest obstacles towards his appointment. \u2018I am loving my job at the moment,\u2019 said Vaughan. \u2018I really enjoy the media work and I am now looking forward to getting to the West Indies to watch England win a series they should win and continue where they left off in Test cricket against India last year.\u2019 It will be fascinating to watch Vaughan commentate for BBC\u2019s Test Match Special on a team he may well soon be in charge of. England coach Peter Moores has said he could work with Vaughan despite their uneasy relationship Paul Downton lost his job as the England and Wales Cricket Board's managing director of cricket Alec Stewart (Age 52) CURRENT JOB: Director of cricket at Surrey. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Played 133 Tests, more than any England cricketer.

REASON IT MIGHT HAPPEN: Stewart has added his name to the ring of potential candidates, and knows the job of director of cricket inside out. REASON IT MIGHT NOT: He\u2019s only interested if there\u2019s a clear line of accountability. May demand a say in selection. Andrew Strauss (Age 38) CURRENT JOB: Sky commentator. SHOW US YOUR MEDALS: Captained England to home-and-away Ashes triumphs. PLAYERS HE LIKES: A big fan of his former opening partner Alastair Cook, who he insists will score plenty of Test runs this summer.

The state-backed giant reached the milestone yesterday as it lurched to a \u00a3446million loss for the first three months of the year. It comes after RBS was forced to put aside \u00a3856million to cover lawsuits and fines still being decided, including an extra \u00a3334million for its part in rigging the foreign exchange market with other banks. Down: RBS reposted a \u00a3446million loss in the first three months of the year In addition to fines in the US, the latest bill includes provision for compensating customers mis-sold payment protection insurance and fee-paying packaged accounts in the UK. RBS was also hit with a \u00a3453million restructuring charge, mainly due to a slump in the value of premises in the US. The loss is a blow to taxpayers, who own 80 per cent of the bank, and comes at an awkward time for Chancellor George Osborne, six days before the General Election. A return to profit for both RBS and state-backed Lloyds would have boosted his claims to have fixed the banks bailed out by taxpayers under the Labour government in 2008. Lloyds has returned to profit and is gradually being sold off to the private sector, but the losses at RBS suggest taxpayers are a long way from recouping some of the \u00a346billion bailout that saved the bank from collapse during the financial crisis.

The dramatic event could explain why our planet has a hot core that gives it its magnetic field. And it could also explain why certain rare-earth elements in Earth\u2019s mantle do not seem to originate from the planet\u2019s other building blocks - meteorites. Oxford scientists say a Mercury-like body struck the young Earth (artist's illustration shown). The object would have been the heat source for our planet's core. The same object could have been responsible for creating the moon. It also explains where some rare-Earth elements came from The study, by two scientists from the University of Oxford, was published in the journal Nature. Our current theory of Earth\u2019s formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. However, this model cannot explain where the heat source for Earth\u2019s core - and ultimately its magnetic field - came from. In addition, Earth\u2019s crust and mantle appear to have a higher ratio of the rare-earth elements samarium and neodymium than most meteorites - suggesting there was more at play in Earth\u2019s formation than first thought. To address this discrepancy, scientists believe that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars - but like Mercury in its composition - early in its life. This likely would have happened about 4.5 billion years ago. The body would have been rich in sulphur but very poor in oxygen - just like Mercury. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. Our current theory of Earth\u2019s (left) formation involves basically more and more asteroids and other objects accumulating into one body. Now scientists think that Earth was hit by a body that was the size of Mars, but like Mercury (right) in its composition, early in its life. In the young solar system 4.5 billion years ago, illustrated, various planetesimals and other small bodies coalesced together to form larger bodies like Earth As it collided with Earth, it would have produced radioactive uranium and thorium, generating the heat needed to drive the \u2018dynamo\u2019 of molten iron in Earth\u2019s core. And they do not rule out the possibility that this is the same Mars-sized body that formed the moon. \u2018We think that that is quite conceivable,\u2019 said study co-author Bernard Wood, reported the LA Times. \u2018It's kind of exciting to think that this reduced body could actually be the thing which caused the moon.\u2019 In an accompanying News and Views article for Nature, Dr Richard Carlson of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington, DC said the theory could open up new avenues for thought.. For example, if true, it would raise further questions about \u2018how Earth ended up in its present oxidised state, which it has apparently retained for more than three billion years.\u2019", "reference": "oxford scientists say a mercury-like body struck the young earth . the mars-sized object would have been the heat source for our planet . the same object could have been responsible for creating the moon . it also explains where some rare-earth elements came from .", "sentences": ["oxford scientists say a mercury-like body struck the young earth .", "the object would have been the heat source for our planet 's core .", "the same object could have been responsible for creating the moon .", "the study , by two scientists from the university of oxford , was published in the journal nature ."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "factuality_types": ["NoE", "NoE", "NoE", "NoE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"oxford scientists say a mercury-like body struck the young earth .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states exactly that Oxford scientists claim a Mercury-like body hit the young Earth.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the object would have been the heat source for our planet 's core .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript says the colliding object would have generated the heat for Earth\u2019s core, matching the summary sentence.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the same object could have been responsible for creating the moon .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript notes scientists do not rule out that the same body formed the Moon, so \u2018could have\u2019 is accurate.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the study , by two scientists from the university of oxford , was published in the journal nature .\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript directly states the study was by two Oxford scientists and was published in Nature.\",\n    \"category\": \"no error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["no error", "no error", "no error", "no error"]}

if the claims of sourcing from rogue palm oil producers are proven.Temasek's investment in Olam means that the people of Singapore have unwittingly financed what is likely one of the world's black boxes for the kind of unsustainably produced palm oil that fuels the haze, the report says.Temasek has dismissed the allegations, explaining that they fully support no-burn policies for land clearance, and would urge oil palm companies and plantation owners to do the same.The fund told the BBC: Olam's operations are properly matters for the board and management of Olam to address.As a matter of proper governance, Temasek does not direct the business operations of our portfolio companies, including Olam.It would be fair to say that the palm oil industry globally has a troubled track record.It is one of the world's biggest industries, projected to be worth $88bn by 2022 but also often accused of unfair and illegal labour practices, as well as deforestation and the burning of plantations.Green groups and palm oil executives often find themselves at loggerheads with one another - NGOs say that the industry is wilfully turning a blind eye to environmentally unfriendly practices, while palm oil executives claim it is an industry-wide problem, and policing third party suppliers is impossible.Activists say governments need to punish palm oil firms that don't comply with acceptable standards of protecting the environment - but changing the government mindset can be challenging, because the reality is many of these firms bring jobs and investment to rural areas.The report also highlights concerns in the African state of Gabon, where according to Mighty, Olam bulldozes rainforests to establish monoculture palm oil plantations, bringing the same practices to Africa that have destroyed vast natural landscapes in Southeast Asia.In response to the accusation that Olam is responsible for vast forest clearings through its joint ventures with the government of Gabon, Olam said its private-public partnerships in the country strove to be both responsible and transparent.We agree with Gabon's sovereign right to convert a tiny percentage of its least valuable forested land for agriculture, so long as it is responsibly and transparently done, it said.Our plans and progress for developing sustainable palm oil plantations have been shared transparently with stakeholders and put in the public domain.", "reference": "palm oil giant olam has been accused of using suppliers that may use unsustainable practices in parts of southeast asia.", "sentences": ["singapore and indonesia have accuses of the names of the names of 14 party suppliers, including palm oil from third party suppliers."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["GramE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"singapore and indonesia have accuses of the names of the names of 14 party suppliers, including palm oil from third party suppliers.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The sentence is grammatically incoherent (\\\"have accuses of the names of the names\\\"), rendering its meaning unclear and unverifiable against the transcript.\",\n    \"category\": \"grammatical error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["grammatical error"]}

Very sombre mood in the office, he added.Times Literary Supplement editor Stig Abell tweeted that Gill had been the first journalist I learned to recognise purely from his style.John Witherow, editor of the Sunday Times from 1994 to 2012, said Gill had been extraordinary and unique.In all the years I was editor of The Sunday Times, he never once produced a boring sentence or a phrase that did not shine.Another former editor, Andrew Neil, added: Hired AA for Sunday Times in 1993. He never forgot what he saw as huge favour. As one of finest writers of our time, he was doing the favour.Former Daily Mirror editor and TV presenter Piers Morgan tweeted that Gill had trashed him for 20 years, but always did so with magnificently eloquent savagery as well as an irritating kernel of truth.While his writing remained popular, Gill's articles often caused controversy.In October 2009, he described how he had shot a baboon while in Tanzania, prompting outrage from animal rights groups.In 1998, he described the Welsh as dark, ugly little trolls - a comment that was referred to the Commission for Racial Equality - while he once described Rhyl as a town only a man driving a crane with a demolition ball would visit with a smile.In a critical review of a Norfolk pub, he referred to the county as the hernia on the end of England, while in 2006 he upset residents of the Isle of Man by saying it smelled of boiled washing.In 2010, he was censured by the former press watchdog having written a review of Clare Balding's 2010 Britain by Bike TV programme, in which he described her as a dyke on a bike.He was also once thrown out of one of Gordon Ramsay's restaurants, along with his dining partner, actress Joan Collins.Born in Edinburgh in 1954, Gill had overcome dyslexia to forge a career as a writer.He went to the independent St Christopher School in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire, and studied at the Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Slade School of Fine Art, in London.He began his writing career in the 1980s with art reviews for magazines, before writing for Tatler and then the Sunday Times.His first marriage was to author Cressida Connolly in 1983. He married current Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who was then a venture capitalist, in 1991.They had two children together - Flora and Alistair - but later divorced.Gill's illness had prompted his engagement to his partner of 23 years, Nicola Formby, with whom he also had two children - twins Edith and Isaac.He said he had been surprisingly excited to be getting married to Ms Formby, who he often referred as The Blonde in his restaurant reviews.", "reference": "sunday times restaurant critic aa gill has died, aged 62, three weeks after revealing he had cancer.", "sentences": ["the sunday times editor adrian gill has died at the age of 74."], "raw_annotations": {"annotator_0": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["OutE"]}, "annotator_1": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE", "OutE"]}, "annotator_2": {"factuality_labels": [1], "factuality_types": ["CircE"]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"sentence\": \"the sunday times editor adrian gill has died at the age of 74.\",\n    \"reason\": \"The transcript states that Adrian Gill was a columnist (not the Sunday Times editor) and, given his 1954 birth year, he would have been 62 at death, not 74.\",\n    \"category\": \"entity error\"\n  }\n]", "pred_faithfulness_labels": [1], "pred_faithfulness_error_type": ["entity error"]}

Rhodri Giggs, 37, revealed that he is now unemployed as he lost his licence after being found guilty of driving a Mercedes C200 without insurance. Under the 'totting-up' procedure, the former player-manager of non-league side Salford City, was forced to hand over his licence having already accrued six points from two previous speeding offences. Arriving for sentencing at Manchester Magistrates Court yesterday dressed in a black blazer and jeans, Giggs, of Salford said the offence on October 14 last year 'wasn't intentional'. But Eddie Coyle, prosecuting, said: 'On October 14 last year at around 9.30pm, he was driving a Mercedes along Hyde Road in Ardwick when he was brought to a stop by officers who performed checks and confirmed no insurance was in force.' After accepting his wrongdoing, Giggs was asked whether he would like to pursue an 'exceptional hardship' application in an attempt to retain his licence. He declined but added that he would permanently lose his job as an HGV driver with an agency and hadn't worked since December as he was waiting for the decision of the courts. Speaking for himself with no legal representation, he said: 'I work for an agency. If I lost my job I could get something else. 'I want to get this sorted today. I haven't worked since December and have no income or benefits.' Giggs was then banned from driving for six months, fined \u00a3110 and ordered to pay a \u00a320 victim surcharge and \u00a385 costs. In January, Rhodri Giggs spoke for the first time about his brother Ryan's eight-year affair with his then wife Natasha In January, Giggs spoke for the first time about his 41-year-old brother Ryan's eight-year affair with his then-wife Natasha which emerged in 2011. The Manchester United assistant manager allegedly told Rhodri that the affair was only ever 'about sex' Natasha Giggs later filed for divorce and went on to appear on Celebrity Big Brother, while Ryan's wife Stacey stood by his side. Giggs enjoyed a successful non-league football career playing for FC United of Manchester and is a former manager of Salford City.

Those five words, when uttered or sung, makes baby boomers immediately think of Don McLean's pop masterpiece American Pie.  It's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8\u00bd minute allegory, which millions of Americans know by heart, is 44 years old.  All sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song, brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus, which starts as Bye, Bye, Miss American Pie. There is no real way to categorize McLean's American Pie for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock. On Tuesday, Christie's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song's lyrics for $1.2 million to an unnamed buyer. McLean was a paperboy when, on February 3, 1959, he saw that Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. The Big Bopper Richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in Clear Lake, Iowa. The next day I went to school in shock and guess what? McLean recalled.  Nobody cared.  Rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and Buddy hadn't had a big hit on the charts since '57.  By cathartically writing American Pie, McLean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever. Having recorded his first album, Tapestry, in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the generation lost in space.   When his cultural anthem American Pie was released in November 1971, it replaced Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A Changin as the Peoples Almanac of the new decade.  It's important to think of American Pie as one would of Henry Longfellow's Evangeline or Johnny Mercer's Moon River -- an essential Americana poem emanating wistful recollection, blues valentine, and youthful protest rolled into one.  There is magic brewing in the music and words of American Pie, for McLean's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream, like those Jack Kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel On the Road. Don McLean: Buddy Holly, rest in peace Influenced by Pete Seeger and the Weavers, McLean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s, when American Pie topped the Billboard charts, and has never shed the cape.   Wandering far and wide, singing American Pie at windblown dance halls in Wyoming and cloistered colleges in New England, at huge amphitheaters in California and little coffee houses in the Hudson River Valley, McLean has performed his global anthem thousands of times.  Yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure. When McLean prods audiences by rhapsodizing and they were singing everybody spontaneously joins in with the Bye, Bye chorus.  Watching McLean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective Happening. What makes American Pie so unusual is that it isn't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman, which, like a sacred river, keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere.  When American Pie suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it's almost impossible not to sing along.   Like Danny Boy or Streets of Laredo or Shenandoah, it's eternal.  With illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll, river levees and nursery rhymes, the song cascades along like a boat going down Niagara Falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes. After all these years, American Pie still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss.  The song is alive and joyful, yet fretful about a world gone wrong.  It is a song that will never die.  A reverie for the ages.   There is a jump to the chorus, which forces the mind to relive the '50s, '60s and '70s, to troll through the back pages of our lives while, like a traditional Irish folksong, it reminds us of fate. While McLean, the muse, has rightfully not tried to interpret American Pie, it's fair to surmise that the king is Elvis Presley, Helter Skelter refers to the Charles Manson murders, the jester on the sidelines in a cast is Bob Dylan, and Jack Flash the Rolling Stones.  But who knows?  The lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations.  As a literary artifact of the early 1970s, there isn't anything to compare to American Pie. Normally, I don't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents, for that matter.  But the fact that the Recording Industry of America and the National Endowment of the Arts chose American Pie as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition's importance as an enduring piece of pop art.  The other four were Over the Rainbow (by Harold Arlen and E.Y Yip Harburg), White Christmas (by Irving Berlin), This Land is Your Land (by Woody Guthrie) and Respect (by Otis Redding).  That is fine company. Quite simply, American Pie is one of the greatest songs ever written.

I think we're going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth within a decade, and I think we're going to have definitive evidence within 20 to 30 years, NASA chief scientist Ellen Stofan said Tuesday during a panel discussion on water in the universe. We know where to look. We know how to look, she said. In most cases, we have the technology, and we're on a path to implementing it. And so I think we're definitely on the road. NASA released a graphic noting that scientists have found evidence or indications of water on a number of celestial bodies, including the dwarf planet Ceres and Jupiter's moon Europa. The Hubble Space Telescope has been key to the discoveries, NASA said in a news release. Scientists using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope recently provided powerful evidence that (Jupiter's moon) Ganymede has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice, the agency noted. There are some caveats involved, of course. NASA isn't talking about intelligent alien civilizations from the Alpha Quadrant; it's referring to microorganisms. We are not talking about little green men, Stofan said at the panel. We are talking about little microbes. Still, former astronaut John Grunsfeld said it's an exciting time -- and he thinks it's just a matter of time before we find life outside our solar system as well. I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation on a planet around a nearby star, he said. And, he added, who knows what that life will look like? Once we get out beyond Mars, the likelihood that it's similar to Earth because we share that material gets very, very low, he said.

We wish them every success in the futureThe task now for Hibernian is to find a head coach who will lead us back into Scotland's top flight by winning the Championship this season.We expect high calibre candidates, and while we understand there will be a lot of speculation, as ever this club will go about its business quietly and professionally and speak when there is something meaningful to say.Speaking for the first time since his appointment at New York Stadium, Stubbs admitted it was a really difficult decision to leave Hibs, but that moving to the Championship in England was the next chapter for his career.Rotherham finished one place outside the relegation zone last season but Stubbs believes he can guide the team up the table to match his own ambitions and those of chairman Tony Stewart.I was impressed by what the chairman had to say, what his vision is for the club and the ambition, he explained.The club's had two seasons where they've stabilised in the Championship and we're looking to take the club forward. We want to be moving up the table and ultimately we want to be a club that is around the play-offs. That has to be the aim.Media playback is not supported on this deviceThe plan has always been to be the best I can. I wanted to manage at the very top level.

And he confirmed that compensation will be paid to the Easter Road club.Alan had another year on his contract, so we did the protocol with Hibs, Stewart said. My CEO had discussions with them to talk to Alan and that led to the appointment. We agreed a settlement with Hibs and we move forward now freely.We've followed Alan's career. He was on the radar months ago, the timing was right and we took the opportunity. I like the drive, the leadership.Football is about moving around.

And while it was a good day Woods, the golfing great still had some stressful moments and still has a way to go in catching up to leader, 21-year-old Jordan Spieth. Heading into the weekend he is a very, very distant 12 strokes behind a seemingly unstoppable Spieth, with 36 holes left to play. Scroll down for video Lindsey Vonn was back at Augusta Friday to watch boyfriend Tiger Woods (above) play in the second round of the Masters Vonn (above) looked stressed at times though Woods played a solid round, carding a three-under-par 69 Woods is still well behind the leader, hot young American star Jordan Spieth (above) This as\u00a0Woods, competing after a two-month absence to retool his game, showed flashes of his old magic as he fired his best score at the Masters in four years in Friday's second round. The former world number one has been under intense scrutiny after struggling badly with his chipping when last seen on the PGA Tour but he played solidly at steamy Augusta National to card a three-under-par 69. That left Woods at two-under 142, far behind the pacesetting American Spieth, but still delighted to be in contention after working hard to resurrect his game. If Spieth wins he would tie the record for the youngest winner in Masters history with Woods This was Vonn's second day in a row cheering on Woods 'I'm still right there,' 14-time major winner Woods said of his position going into the weekend 'I was at a pretty low one (point) in my career,' Woods said after mixing four birdies with a bogey to climb into a tie for 14th when he ended his round. 'To basically change an entire (swing) pattern like that and put it together, put it in a position where I can compete in a major championship like this is something I'm very proud of.' Woods, who plunged to 111th in the rankings as he struggled to return to form following back surgery last year and his fifth swing change, again struggled with the pace of Augusta National's heavily contoured greens. 'I had a hard time getting the ball close to the hole,' said Woods. 'You expect certain putts to roll out, but they're not rolling out.' Watched by huge galleries, Woods made a fast start, hitting a superb approach to seven feet at the par-four first and rolling in the birdie putt as shouts of 'Watch out, Tiger's back' and 'Come on Tiger, let's go' rang out. Spieth, 21, broke the 36 hole record on Friday and is 14-under-par for the tournament, 12 strokes ahead of Woods His only bogey came at the par-three sixth, his tee shot ending up just off the back of the green from where he had 45 feet to the flag but hit a weak chip that advanced just 20 feet. Woods immediately rebounded in birdie-birdie style, draining a 25-footer at the tricky seventh and hitting his third shot at the par-five eighth to two feet. He birdied the 11th after conjuring a moment of magic from the pine straw to the right of the fairway, a soaring approach settling 12 feet from the cup. 'I'm still right there,' the 14-time major winner said of his position going into the weekend. 'I'm 12 back, but there's not a lot of guys ahead of me.

It is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in Birmingham\u00a0where extremist Islamic views were being forced on pupils and staff. This includes allegations an al-Qaeda style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles. More than 50 teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby was a hoax. Scroll down for video Park View School in Birmingham was one of the schools placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism - up to 100 teachers are now being investigated It is understood the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) - the profession's watchdog responsible for banning teachers from classrooms - is looking at 30 disciplinary cases, with an expectation many more teachers will be targeted for their part in the affair. The probe into the Islamic plot last year found evidence of anti-Western rhetoric, intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against Muslims. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Allegations under investigation include claims that an al-Qaeda style video was copied at Park View Academy and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor, the Sunday Times reports. A group of teachers - called the Park View Brotherhood - also alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group where they claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings, where two bombs were set off at the finish line of the city's marathon, were a hoax. Professional hearings are set to begin next month. More than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a WhatsApp group which included offensive comments about British soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich,  was a hoax In his report, Peter Clarke (pictured) found there had been a 'coordinated, deliberate and sustained action' to introduce an aggressive Islamic ethos in the schools The teaching watchdog has obtained 'dossiers' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the Department for Education as part of its inquiries. They are understood to include information from last year's Trojan Horse probe headed by Peter Clarke, the former head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard. His report, published in July, found there had been a 'co-ordinated, deliberate and sustained action, carried out by a number of associated individuals, to introduce an intolerant and aggressive Islamic ethos into a few schools in Birmingham'. It also highlighted a 'disconcerting pattern' in the schools, including nepotism in staff appointments, bullying of senior teachers, a 'strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher' and the 'reinforcement of Muslim identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others'. A source told the Sunday Times: 'The 100 or so include teachers, teaching assistants and teaching staff. The Department for Education is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the NCTL has, and, in other cases, flag up new targets.' 'In some cases, some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools, and in other cases they have been removed. 'But although some of them have been removed, the NCTL does not want them to end up anywhere else.' The Trojan Horse scandal started with an anonymous letter in March last year describing an Islamic plot to take over schools in Birmingham called 'Operation Trojan Horse'. The document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda. That in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector Ofsted, which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism. Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School, Park View School - all run by the Park View Educational Trust - Oldknow Academy and Saltley School in Birmingham were placed in special measures. Another school investigated, Alston Primary, was already in special measures. Then in November last year, inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in Tower Hamlets, in east London, had an unbalanced curriculum. Several teenage girls have fled to join ISIS in Syria from schools in Tower Hamlets. This Easter, tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by Tower Hamlets council advising parents to 'lock away' their children's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to Syria over the holiday period. Tower Hamlets is the only local authority in London where Muslims account for the largest single religious group.

Carlos Boente, 33, was serving time at HMP Birmingham for similar harassment type offences when he began contacting the 19-year-old woman in November 2013. After getting her number from a cellmate, the prisoner originally asked her to change his Facebook password as a favour. He then bombarded the teen with thousands of texts and calls - telling her sob stories about his life saying he had no family and nobody visited him in prison. The victim continued to talk to Boente, who she felt sorry for, but he suddenly started asking where she was and leaving threatening messages if she didn't reply. She eventually contacted police when he told her he had friends on the outside watching her and even sent her a picture of her front door. In January last year Boente made numerous abusive calls to the woman - telling her she was going to die and making threats against her young child. Incredibly, he even sent three men to the home of the woman's aunt and uncle, before boasting on Facebook the gang were his 'soldiers'. Boente, from Birmingham, was charged with two counts of threats to kill, one count of harassment, one count of conspiracy to burgle and three counts of possessing a mobile phone while in prison in June last year. He denied all of the charges, except for two counts of possessing a mobile phone, but was found guilty of conspiracy to burgle, harassment and the remaining phone possession charge on April 1. Although he was cleared of the threats to kill charges he was last week jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Detective Constable Vanessa Lewis, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Even when the victim was giving a statement to us about Boente's behaviour, we witnessed him constantly calling her, shouting down the phone and being abusive. 'Despite knowing we were investigating him, Boente showed no signs of stopping his disturbing conduct. 'On 24 March, shortly after we blocked his letters and landline contact from the prison, three men entered the home of the woman's aunt and uncle looking for a safe. 'Boente's Facebook status two days later, boasting that he sent his 'soldiers' to the property indicated he was behind the burglary. Boente was serving time at HMP Birmingham (pictured) when he began contacting the woman 'This is a highly unusual case which demonstrates Boente's ability to control, manipulate and harass young women. 'Boente has a proven history of violence and at the time of these crimes, he was serving a prison sentence for similar harassment offences. 'It is clear that Boente, who operated four Facebook accounts through five different phones from behind bars, thinks he is above the law and unfortunately, does not see prison as a barrier to his bizarre behaviour.
