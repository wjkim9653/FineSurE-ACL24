' i think i 'm going to be his type of player , ' he said . but alas , that did not prove to be the case . the 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to aston villa , where he has played 30 times . he is not wanted back at united . villa and everton are keen to sign the england international . unwanted by manchester united , aston villa and everton want to sign england international tom cleverley . left wing - jonas gutierrez ( newcastle ) . bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the newcastle squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club . will be 32 in the summer , but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him . testicular cancer survivor jonas gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't newcastle . striker - danny ings ( burnley ) . one of a number of young english strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for burnley this season . rumoured to be of interest to manchester united and their neighbours city , as well as david moyes ' real sociedad . manchester united and city are said to be interested in burnley 's dangerous striker danny ings . striker - james wilson ( manchester united ) . promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under ryan giggs against hull . the 19-year-old has played 16 times under van gaal , but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close , the united academy product is yet to agree terms . james wilson , 19 , has played 16 times under louis van gaal but is now struggling to get on the bench .\n", "reference": "<t> swansea 's gerhard tremmel in goal behind the free agents ' 4-4-2 . </t> <t> glen johnson , kolo toure , ron vlaar and luke garbutt at the back . </t> <t> james milner , mikel arteta , tom cleverley and jonas gutierrez in midfield . </t> <t> burnley 's danny ings and manchester united 's james wilson up front . </t>\n", "sentences": ["manchester city's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent .", "england's first-choice right-back at the world cup looks set to leave liverpool after six years this summer .", "with the premier league season entering its final stretch , focus is now turning to the summer transfer window ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Gerhard Tremmel plays for Swansea\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Gerhard Tremmel was in goal\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Gerhard Tremmel played for free agents' 4 -4-2\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Glen Johnson was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Kolo Toure was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Ron Vlaar was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Luke Garbutt was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"James Milner was in midfield\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Mikel Arteta was in the midfield\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Tom Cleverly was in the midfield\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Jonas Gutierrez was in the midfield\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Danny Ings plays for Burnley\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Danny Ings was up front\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"James Wilson plays for Manchester United\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"James Wilson was up front\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1]}

' leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . after being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . the singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . but can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . the partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . she even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently . ' everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment . but while andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like the x factor might bring . her debut single , a cover of evanescence 's my immortal , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , dancing in the dark , originally by bruce springsteen , did n't make it any further than 113 . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . if a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . the singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . the glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie . so can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of the voice uk ? his debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year . the scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival t in the park already . stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism . when asked if he 's worried about the growing number of the voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before .

west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at

how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough .

' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Fan site Appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on Apple's recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .", "These include an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer and an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer .", "Apple said its All - day battery life is based on 18 hours of use .", "This includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted nine listings\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings last month\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings related to batteries\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appled improved battery life\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 plus was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for phones\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for tablets\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that phones don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that tablets don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2]}

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

' the chances i do get , i love to take in the whole thing , my eyes will be wide open as i sit in the front row , ' he says .

' there are so many different designers with so many styles now , it\u2019s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that , there are so many handwritings , so i think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week .

' and at the same time you can australian designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it .

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas .

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .", "these include one for an ios battery life software engineer -lrb- pictured left -rrb- and another for ios software power systems engineer -lrb- pictured right -rrb- .", "the job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider and include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer .", "audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted nine listings\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings last month\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings related to batteries\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appled improved battery life\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 plus was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for phones\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for tablets\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that phones don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that tablets don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2]}
