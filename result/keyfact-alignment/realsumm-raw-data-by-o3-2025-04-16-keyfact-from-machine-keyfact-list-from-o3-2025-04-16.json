it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Carl Froch hasn't fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May .", "Froch has been away from the ring for nearly a year and is now 12st 7 lbs .", "Anthony Dirrell's IBF world title and Andre Dirrell's people have already been in touch with me about a fight in the event that he wins , but I wonder if it is big enough .", "I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights .", "He is walking around at 12st 7 lbs and in the gym four to five days a week a week .", "I 've held talks with Gennady Golovkin's manager Gennady go ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Carl Froch beat George Groves at Wembley in May 2014\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Carl Froch has not fought since that victory\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Carl Froch has been inactive for nearly one year\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Carl Froch currently weighs 12 st 7 lbs\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2, 5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Carl Froch trains in the gym four to five days per week\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Andre Dirrell's representatives have contacted Froch's camp about a fight\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The possible Dirrell fight would involve Anthony Dirrell's IBF world title\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Carl Froch is closely watching upcoming fights\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Froch's camp has held talks with Gennady Golovkin's manager\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [6]\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
