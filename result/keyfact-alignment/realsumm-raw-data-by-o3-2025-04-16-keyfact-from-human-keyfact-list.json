but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

'' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\n", "reference": "<t> attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it . </t> <t> harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used . </t> <t> in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates , 73 , says he meant to use his stun gun but fired his handgun instead .", "Experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body , and the Taser on the nondominant side .", "Bates ' attorney says his client is left - handed , but the reserve deputy said his gun was on his right side .", "In 2009 , a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser , killing 22-year - old Oscar Grant ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates made an assumption.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates assumed the gun is a taser because Bates saw a laser sight on the gun .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Harris family lawyers say there are differences between the gun and Taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California made a statement in 2009.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he mistakenly used his gun.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he used his gun instead of a taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates thought the gun was a Taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

' miss begum added : \u2018 it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . it happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . \u2019 career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : \u2018 we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . it was late at night on the friday or saturday . i ca n't remember which . \u2018 i heard some type of noise . i 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . but i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? \u2019 former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . on saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . the pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . the group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . but one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . saturday , march 28 . thursday , april 2 . friday , april 3 . saturday , april 4 . sunday , april 5 . tuesday , april 7 . mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . instead he 's come back for more . ' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' he added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gang\u2019s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ? the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company\u2019s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . loot smuggled out of the country ? some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be \u2018 a doddle\u2019 . what about the \u2018 king of diamonds\u2019 ? a criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . the panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with \u00a313million worth of jewellery .\n", "reference": "<t> locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist . </t> <t> they also tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises on evening of good friday . </t> <t> group seen returning to scene on saturday - a day after initial break-in . </t> <t> police admit they did n't respond after alarm went off early on friday . </t>\n", "sentences": ["they also claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of good friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks .", "meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central london to steal more loot after becoming ` greedy ' .", "residents living yards from the scene of the # 60million hatton garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ` peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"There were power cuts the weekend before the raid\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Locals say power cuts could be linked to heist.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Locals tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Locals tell of noises on evening of Good Friday.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Group was seen returning to scene.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Group was seen on Saturday.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The day after initial break - in was Saturday.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Police admit they didn't respond after alarm went off.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The alarm went off early on Friday.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Domenico Rancadore , 65 , fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in Italy for his role as a ` Man of Honour ' .", "He was sentenced to seven years in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra .", "In February he lost his year - and - a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence .", "Today it emerged that the 65 - year - old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore given a sentence.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced for 7 years.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced by Italian court.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced in 1999.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was convicted for role as Man of Honour.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore took bribes from builders.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a Sicilian Mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore lost battle against extradition to Italy.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Today a news emerged.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a 65 year old.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired in October last year.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}

applegreen garage before her course started . she failed last july to have her conviction overturned , though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent . her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the justice minister . the course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed .

{"doc_id": "cnndm8815", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "unilm_out_v2", "transcript": "simon wood , 38 , from oldham won masterchef last friday . wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next gordon ramsay or jamie oliver should take note - it doesn't have to cost a fortune . the new winner of masterchef simon wood , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson . everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self-taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows . he told mailonline : 'it\u2019s all self-taught . there\u2019s no more to it than that . you can achieve anything if you try hard enough and you\u2019re passionate enough . ' i learnt what i know from reading , websites like youtube , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it . ' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen . ' i can\u2019t help it , it\u2019s like watching tv and if it\u2019s happening in front of you , you can\u2019t help but watch what they do . ' while simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven . the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the wood household lunchboxes can become works of art . he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i\u2019m practising . ' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you\u2019re at my house . ' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it\u2019s in the fridge or freezer it\u2019s likely to come out at some point or another . 'they\u2019re not fussy at all though . they\u2019re like me , there\u2019s nothing i don\u2019t like and that has carried on through to them too . it makes life a lot easier . ' scroll down for video . simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight , he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper . but he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young . the couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam . simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon decided to take up a career in it instead . his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired . he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming . ' it was a moment in all of our lives that we\u2019ll remember and will treasure and look back on . ' simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg wallace , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers ' . simon said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they\u2019re practically idols of yours and you\u2019ve not met them before that . ' then it all starts to get very real very quickly . it\u2019s a daunting prospect that\u2019s in front of you . ' so the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really . ' but simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti-frutti . simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he said : ' you grow so quickly when you\u2019re down there . you get feedback from people that you\u2019d never normally meet and they\u2019re so good at what they do - everyone down there is . ' i got loads of really good feedback down there . i had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves \u2013 i think it showed as well . ' for anyone looking to follow simon 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it . he said : ' if you don\u2019t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you haven\u2019t made something you believe in or enjoyed making . that comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that\u2019s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience . ' if you don\u2019t enjoy it i don\u2019t think your guests will either . ' simon has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster . as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink . he said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did christmas dinner for the first time . ' i had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock . ' i simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock . ' then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i didn\u2019t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on \u2013 think about what you\u2019re doing . ' i don\u2019t think there is anything i can\u2019t cook though . i think i\u2019ve shown throughout the competition that i\u2019m good with most things that get thrown at me . ' simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette . he said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette . ' and if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad . ' nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that\u2019s it \u2013 done . ' just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette . ' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant . for the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie . he said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually \u2013 it\u2019s every cook or chef\u2019s dream . ' if you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing . ' i think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it\u2019s really good . ' i think i\u2019d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist . ' something that looks nice , is achievable . but is also quite opulent and refined and nice . ' also something that isn\u2019t out of everybody\u2019s reach .

' miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident , thanks to mr shiraz who had evacuated the nearby takeaway . the former gas engineer told the staff to turn off the gas supply and also rang the fire service after the incident in the busy stratford road , shirley , solihull . firefighters extinguished the blaze , which they said was caused by a fire in an underground link box - which distributes electricity - below the manhole . neighbouring properties had to be evacuated and many others lost power for several hours as crews tackled the electrical fire which was thought to have started accidentally . shiraz , who now fits kitchens and bathrooms , said : ' to think that i had just walked over that . ' the flames kept shooting up - maybe five or six times . the smoke was followed by a quick blast of flame which shot out of the manhole on the pedestrian walkway . flames shot up to a startling 15-foot high and could be reaching the top of the nearby shop and take away fronts . ' i 'm a building contractor so i knew that when i heard the noises it was something to do with electrics . it was like a buzzing . ' i knew what it was but i did n't expect flames to come shooting out straight away or anything like that . shiraz was walking from his home to the dixie chicken shop around the corner from his home when he saw the flames at around 7pm on monday . ' i got my phone out because i heard the actual noise and i think i saw a flash , ' he said . ' i think i managed to get it on film just as the first real flames came up . ' it looked like it was coming from a manhole cover . it was quite shocking . ' i told the guys in the shop to switch off the gas and get everyone out . i told them to stop any unassuming person from walking down the road while i stayed on the other side . flames were followed by more plumes of dark smoke continued to billow up out of the charred ground reaching several feet high . miraculously nobody was hurt in the incident after shiraz evacuated the nearby takeaway , told them to turn off their gas supply , and called the fire service . ' the guy in the shop grabbed me a couple of burgers after everything , so i guess it had a happy ending . ' a spokesman for west midlands fire service said : ' we had a number of calls about about it - probably five or six , maybe a couple more . ' it involved a fire in an underground electrical link box . the electrical supply was isolated by western power . ' power was isolated to surrounding homes and premises for four hours . ' three people were evacuated from one of the properties . ' we used a co2 extinguisher and a hose real with foam , because it was an electrical fire . it was accidental . ' western power distribution workers were later seen repairing the man hole cover in shirley , solihull . the area had been evacuated and blocked off as western power distribution employees worked to fix the underground link box . incredibly no-one was hurt in the incident and quick-thinking shiraz managed to grab his phone in time to take a film of the astonishing flames .\n", "reference": "<t> shiraz nawaz felt lucky to be alive after the flames shot out the manhole . </t> <t> the fire erupted just moments after he walked over it in the busy street . </t> <t> incredibly no-one was hurt in the incident after nawaz evacuated the area . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Shiraz Nawaz said he felt lucky to be alive after Flames shot out of manhole .", "The 36 - year - old had been walking to his local takeaway in Shirley , Solihull .", "He heard buzzing from the ground just a few feet behind him and noticed blackened cover .", "As he turned around he watched on as thick black smoke began billowing from the manhole .", "Father - of - two was able to grab his phone in time to film the terrifying incident ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Flames shot out the manhole .\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Shiraz Nawaz felt lucky to be alive.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Fire erupted moments after Shiraz Nawaz walked over the manhole.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The manhole was in a busy street .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"No - one was hurt in the incident.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Nawaz evacuated the area.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"No-one was hurt after Nawaz evacuated the area .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Shiraz Nawaz walked over the manhole.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"It is incredible that no - one was hurt.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1]}

'' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\n", "reference": "<t> attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it . </t> <t> harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used . </t> <t> in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser . </t>\n", "sentences": ["A 73 - year - old reserve deputy , Robert Bates , killed Eric Harris in Tulsa , Oklahoma .", "Bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his gun instead .", "Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "sentence_labels": [0, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "sentence_labels": [0, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates made an assumption.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates assumed the gun is a taser because Bates saw a laser sight on the gun .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Harris family lawyers say there are differences between the gun and Taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California made a statement in 2009.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he mistakenly used his gun.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he used his gun instead of a taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates thought the gun was a Taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["fan site appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .", "these include one for an ios battery life software engineer -lrb- pictured left -rrb- and another for ios software power systems engineer -lrb- pictured right -rrb- .", "at least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops .", "the job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider and include listings for an ios battery life software engineer , a software power systems engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted nine listings\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1, 4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings last month\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings related to batteries\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2, 4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2, 4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appled improved battery life\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 plus was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for phones\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for tablets\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that phones don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that tablets don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 4]}

' my team and i just need a bit of a breather - we 've just finished selling in paris , and we 've had an incredible season over there , so we 're busy focusing on international at the moment , ' perry told dma at the ellery show on first night of fashion week . scroll down for video . perry pulls out of presenting : acclaimed designer alex perry opts out of showing at this year 's mbfwa . ' we 're busy working on cruise too , ' ( perry 's popular party dress collection ) . ' i wouldn\u2019t be standing here talking to you if we were showing on monday or tuesday , ' he laughs . this is only the second fashion week the design powerhouse has missed in two decades . when asked if he will miss the excitement of running his own show , perry said while he loves it , he 's happy to sit back and see it from a new perspective . ' the chances i do get , i love to take in the whole thing , my eyes will be wide open as i sit in the front row , ' he says . ' because i 'm not presenting a show i can really look forward to supporting some of my friends like kym ( ellery ) and johnny ( schembri from by johnny ) they 're my two faves i 'm specifically wanting to see . ' fashion favourite : perry says kym ellery ( pictured left ) is one of his favourite designers showing this week . on kym ellery 's show , perry says she had a great cast of models and knew the fashion would be beautiful and all about showcasing shape and new directions . as for what he sees trending this season , perry said the australian market is so diverse , anything could happen . ' there are so many different designers with so many styles now , it\u2019s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that , there are so many handwritings , so i think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week . ' ' someone like kym is so incredibly on point internationally at the moment which is her style , but then johnny is going to give us some fun , sexy tight stuff . ' fashion flashback : showing since 1996 , this marks the second time in twenty years perry wo n't show . model moment : perry with cheyenne tozzi ( pictured left ) who previously starred in australia 's next top model . perry also believes the australian market has it 's on unique flair , different to fashion internationally that has a more uniform look . ' we definitely have our own signature . i would n't say relaxed even though people say that all the time , it\u2019s more we have a different take on fashion . there 's a mix of designers that are increadibly accomplished then there are younger designers who take more risks and challenges , ' he says . ' and at the same time you can australian designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it . ' taking a break from the runway , perry now is devoting his time to international enterprises , with a specific focus on the asian and middle eastern market . front row fashionistas : perry front row alongside marie claire 's jackie frank ( left ) and kyly clarke ( right ) . ' asia is a big expansion market and the middle east is huge , it\u2019s had unprecedented growth in so while i\u2019m doing stuff in australia i\u2019m also doing things that resonate in those regions to build brand profile in those countries .

but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Fan site Appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site .", "The job listings were discovered by fan site appleinsider .", "At least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm's official recruitment site .", "Tech Giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts .", "Apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 Plus .", "The IOS Software Engineer Role said the successful candidate ` will be working on design and development of software for triage of Battery Life Trends ' ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted nine listings\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 2, 3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings last month\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings related to batteries\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [6]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Appled improved battery life\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 was improved\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 plus was improved\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for phones\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for tablets\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that phones don't last a day\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that tablets don't last a day\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}

'' westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . and the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . for buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . the victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . on the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . but he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .\n", "reference": "<t> tim stanley : muhammadu buhar won nigeria vote on campaign against corruption . he 's an ex-dictator , but there 's reason for optimism . </t> <t> he says jonathan administration failed to address corruption , poverty and rise of boko haram . buhar may be tonic to years of misrule . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Nigeria's poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk .", "Soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ;

' there are a few things i 've missed out on , but i do n't feel like i 've missed out i 've made the best of the situation , ' she said . the basketballer , who lives in canberra , has looked after her niece since she was two days old . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams .

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

'' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\n", "reference": "<t> attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it . </t> <t> harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used . </t> <t> in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body , and the Taser should be placed on the nondominant side .", "The Reserve Deputy's attorney said his client is left - handed , but he said his gun was holstered to his right side .", "The officer is a veteran of the Tulsa Police Department ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates made an assumption.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates assumed the gun is a taser because Bates saw a laser sight on the gun .\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Harris family lawyers say there are differences between the gun and Taser.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"An officer in California made a statement in 2009.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he mistakenly used his gun.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he used his gun instead of a taser.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates thought the gun was a Taser.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court .
