' i don\u2019t have to worry now about practical things like making a career for myself . i\u2019m free to go where i\u2019m needed and meet people at the margins . \u2019 she is not the only young woman choosing the religious life . according to church figures , 14 of the 45 women who entered convents last year were aged 30 or under . the next moderator of the free church has claimed the church of scotland is \u2018 literally dying\u2019 because of falling congregation numbers . the rev david robertson said the departure of ministers and \u2018concerns\u2019 over issues such as same-sex marriage are linked to a \u2018 theological and moral decline\u2019 in the kirk . the dundee minister , who will become moderator next month , made the remarks on his blog site the wee flea as the church of scotland prepares to hold the general assembly 2015 in may . the free church has seen modest growth over six years , with about 13,000 people currently attending services . mr robertson said the kirk is losing \u2018 around 16,000 members per year\u2019 . but the church of scotland yesterday hit back , saying it remains one of the country\u2019s \u2018 largest and most robust organisations\u2019 . miss hawksley said : \u2018 there is another person in an order in london and she is 27 and we meet to chat . you are not on your own . it is an unusual life choice , but you are not the only one making it . there are plenty of people asking themselves the same questions . \u2019 she admitted some of her friends were \u2018 a bit bewildered\u2019 , but most had been very supportive . far from being trapped in traditional habits , miss hawksley said her order tends to dress down in t-shirts and jeans . father christopher jamison , director of the national office for vocation of england and wales , said : \u2018 there is a gap in the market for meaning in our culture . one of the ways women may find that meaning is through religious life . \u2019 sister cathy jones , religious life vocations promoter at the office , said : \u2018 we are never going to be at the place we were at 50 years ago , catholic culture was at a very different place . \u2018 but the fact that more women are becoming nuns than in the past 25 years shows that as a generation we have turned a corner . \u2019 last year , bbc northern ireland political reporter martina purdy quit her 25-year career in journalism to become a nun . she said : \u2018 i know many people will not understand this decision . it is a decision i have not come to lightly , but it is one i make with love and

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

' miss begum added : \u2018 it was over that weekend , so before the holborn fire [ under kingsway on april 1 ] as well . it happened on either the friday or the saturday , it was just a bit peculiar . \u2019 career criminal : noel ' razor ' smith , who has 58 convictions and spent 32 years in prison , said the group was likely brought together by a ' mr big ' . another local resident , data scientist john han , 26 , said : \u2018 we heard some type of loud noise which woke us up . it was late at night on the friday or saturday . i ca n't remember which . \u2018 i heard some type of noise . i 'm not sure what it was , but i thought they were just doing road works in the street again . but i did think to myself why would somebody be doing road works at that time ? \u2019 former bank robber noel ' razor ' smith - who was responsible for more than 200 bank robberies during his criminal career - believes the group made an unplanned return to the scene after their initial break-in when they realised their robbery had not been discovered . mr smith , speaking after having analysed video footage of the raid , told the daily mirror the organised criminals would be aware of the huge risk involved in returning for more spoils , but the rewards outweighed the danger . on saturday night , police released dramatic cctv images of the raid in the hope of a breakthrough in the investigation . the pictures show the robbers at work over several days as they take part in the raid on the basement packed with security boxes in london 's diamond district . described as ' highly audacious ' by metropolitan police detectives , the men - wearing adidas tracksuits , builders ' hats and high-visibility jackets - were captured entering the building through a side exit , before leaving hours later with a wheelie bin full of jewels . the gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . the group left the jewellers on good friday after having first appeared on camera the day before . but one of the thieves then reappeared on camera late saturday night - a move mr smith described as a ' huge risk ' . saturday , march 28 . thursday , april 2 . friday , april 3 . saturday , april 4 . sunday , april 5 . tuesday , april 7 . mr smith told reporter david collins , writing for the daily mirror : ' he could be out the country by now spending the rest of his life a very rich man . instead he 's come back for more . ' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' he added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gang\u2019s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ? the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company\u2019s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . loot smuggled out of the country ? some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be \u2018 a doddle\u2019 . what about the \u2018 king of diamonds\u2019 ? a criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . the panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with \u00a313million worth of jewellery .\n", "reference": "<t> locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist . </t> <t> they also tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises on evening of good friday . </t> <t> group seen returning to scene on saturday - a day after initial break-in . </t> <t> police admit they did n't respond after alarm went off early on friday . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Residents living yards from the scene of the # 60million Hatton Garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ` peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime .", "They also claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of Good Friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks .", "Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central London to steal more loot after becoming ` greedy ' .", "Scotland Yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on Good Friday , but it was graded as ` no police response was deemed to be required ' ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"There were power cuts the weekend before the raid\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Locals say power cuts could be linked to heist.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Locals tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Locals tell of noises on evening of Good Friday.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Group was seen returning to scene.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Group was seen on Saturday.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The day after initial break - in was Saturday.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Police admit they didn't respond after alarm went off.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The alarm went off early on Friday.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}
