it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Carl Froch has not fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May .", "The WBC world champion has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7 lbs .", "Froch needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"If Carl Froch doesn't fight in 2015 I 'm not sure he 'll be back at all .\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr defeat\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Anthony Dirrell has made contact .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Scott Quigg - Carl Frampton Summer Fight Is Dead in the water .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [3]}

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court .

it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Carl Froch has not fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May .", "Froch had hoped to meet Julio Cesar Chavez Jr , but he lost to Andrzej Fonfara last week .", "I have held talks with Gennady Golovkin's manager and there is also the possibility of Bernard Hopkins .", "Paul Smith - Andre Ward , Anthony Dirrell and James DeGale are all in the pipeline .", "If he does ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"If Carl Froch doesn't fight in 2015 I 'm not sure he 'll be back at all .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr defeat\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Anthony Dirrell has made contact .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Scott Quigg - Carl Frampton Summer Fight Is Dead in the water .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Carl Froch hasn't fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May .", "Froch has been away from the ring for nearly a year and is now 12st 7 lbs .", "Anthony Dirrell's IBF world title and Andre Dirrell's people have already been in touch with me about a fight in the event that he wins , but I wonder if it is big enough .", "I know he is going to have an eagle eye on all these fights .", "He is walking around at 12st 7 lbs and in the gym four to five days a week a week .", "I 've held talks with Gennady Golovkin's manager Gennady go ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"If Carl Froch doesn't fight in 2015 I 'm not sure he 'll be back at all .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr defeat\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Anthony Dirrell has made contact .\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Scott Quigg - Carl Frampton Summer Fight Is Dead in the water .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [3]}

working . more than half of indians , 40 per cent of chinese and up to 30 per cent of adults in japan , great britain and australia said they would also engage in these kinds of activities . the

' i think i 'm going to be his type of player , ' he said . but alas , that did not prove to be the case . the 25-year-old was farmed out on loan to aston villa , where he has played 30 times . he is not wanted back at united . villa and everton are keen to sign the england international . unwanted by manchester united , aston villa and everton want to sign england international tom cleverley . left wing - jonas gutierrez ( newcastle ) . bravely battled back from testicular cancer to return to the newcastle squad last month , but is no longer wanted by his club . will be 32 in the summer , but still a good operator and would prove an inspirational figure to younger players around him . testicular cancer survivor jonas gutierrez will be an important figure somewhere , even if it is n't newcastle . striker - danny ings ( burnley ) . one of a number of young english strikers pushing for national selection after scoring nine goals for burnley this season . rumoured to be of interest to manchester united and their neighbours city , as well as david moyes ' real sociedad . manchester united and city are said to be interested in burnley 's dangerous striker danny ings . striker - james wilson ( manchester united ) . promoted to the first-team squad last summer following a fairytale debut under ryan giggs against hull . the 19-year-old has played 16 times under van gaal , but has struggled to get on the bench recently and despite rumours of a new deal being close , the united academy product is yet to agree terms . james wilson , 19 , has played 16 times under louis van gaal but is now struggling to get on the bench .\n", "reference": "<t> swansea 's gerhard tremmel in goal behind the free agents ' 4-4-2 . </t> <t> glen johnson , kolo toure , ron vlaar and luke garbutt at the back . </t> <t> james milner , mikel arteta , tom cleverley and jonas gutierrez in midfield . </t> <t> burnley 's danny ings and manchester united 's james wilson up front . </t>\n", "sentences": ["here are best players who are currently set to leave their premier league clubs on a free in june .", "manchester city's tenacious , creative and versatile midfielder james milner could leave as a free agent .", "swansea's gerhard tremmel , 36 , is the understudy for lukasz fabianski but has done well in the cups ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"Gerhard Tremmel plays for Swansea\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Gerhard Tremmel was in goal\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Gerhard Tremmel played for free agents' 4 -4-2\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Glen Johnson was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Kolo Toure was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Ron Vlaar was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Luke Garbutt was at the back\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"James Milner was in midfield\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Mikel Arteta was in the midfield\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Tom Cleverly was in the midfield\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Jonas Gutierrez was in the midfield\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Danny Ings plays for Burnley\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Danny Ings was up front\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"James Wilson plays for Manchester United\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"James Wilson was up front\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [2, 3]}

defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the

' under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . he has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . the bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for \u00a32,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . he also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . he said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . henry viii may have been conceived in bed . the carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . it is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . it has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' he added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son . ' look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of christ and mary ; it 's henry viii 's god complex in a nutshell . ' dr foyle described the 15th century artefact , which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in england , as ' a complete national treasure ' . he added : ' evidence suggests the bed was made for the painted chamber of westminster palace for the marriage ceremony at westminster abbey on january 18 , 1486 . ' mr foyle is backed by other experts , such as diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church at oxford university , who described the rediscovery as ' exceptionally important ' . the medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to \u00a320million , although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display . it is part of the ' a bed of roses ' exhibition at the childhood home of anne boleyn , henry viii 's second wife , at hever castle in kent which also features a portrait of henry viii as a young man . the bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in england . in 2013 , the battle-scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in leicester . meanwhile , in december of the same year , archaeologists uncovered a site in the amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of atahualpa , the last emporer of the incas . and last year , explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to alfred the great in the grounds of hyde abbey in winchester . henry vii 's four-poster bed will remain on display in the long gallery at hever castle in kent until november 22 .\n", "reference": "<t> four-poster bed dumped in a hotel car park and sold at auction for # 2,200 . </t> <t> owner suspected it had historic value and experts have been investigating . </t> <t> historian now claims dna from the timber proves it belonged to henry vii . </t> <t> ornate bed , now on display , was made for king and wife elizabeth of york . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Four - poster bed was left in car park of former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green , Chester , in 2010 .", "Oblivious to its true value and historical significance , builders dismantled it and left it to be picked up by auctioneers .", "It was snapped up for \u00a3 2,200 in 2010 by a bed specialist from Northumberland who spotted it on the internet .", "TV historian Jonathan Foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact's historical roots .", "DNA testing on the bed's timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A bed was dumped.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A bed was left in a hotel car park.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed was a four - poster bed.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed sold at auction for 2,200.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Owner suspected it had historic value.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Experts have been investigating.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Historian now claims the bed belonged to Henry VII .\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4, 5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"DNA from the timber proves who the bed belonged to, it is claimed.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [5]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed is ornate.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed is now on display.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed was made for Henry VII / King.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed was also made for Henry VII's wife / King's wife / Elizabeth of York .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Elizabeth of York was wife of Henry VII / King.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"The bed sold at an auction.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Domenico Rancadore , 65 , has lived in Britain for more than 20 years .", "He was given a seven - year sentence for being a member of the Cosa Nostra .", "In February he lost his year - and - a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence .", "But today it emerged that his European arrest warrant was to be withdrawn .", "Italian law states that ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore given a sentence.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced for 7 years.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced by Italian court.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced in 1999.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was convicted for role as Man of Honour.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore took bribes from builders.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a Sicilian Mafia fugitive.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore lost battle against extradition to Italy.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Today a news emerged.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a 65 year old.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired in October last year.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}

'' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\n", "reference": "<t> attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it . </t> <t> harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used . </t> <t> in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser . </t>\n", "sentences": ["that's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris .", "bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead .

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Domenico Rancadore , 65 , fled to Britain in the 1990s and was convicted in Italy for his role as a ` Man of Honour ' .", "He was sentenced to seven years in 1999 for being a member of the Cosa Nostra .", "In February he lost his year - and - a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence .", "Today it emerged that the 65 - year - old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore given a sentence.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced for 7 years.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced by Italian court.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced in 1999.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was convicted for role as Man of Honour.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore took bribes from builders.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a Sicilian Mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore lost battle against extradition to Italy.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Today a news emerged.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a 65 year old.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired in October last year.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["At least nine job listings have been spotted on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .", "The battery will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour .", "It says its All - day battery life is based on 18 hours of use .", "This includes 90 time checks , 90 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted nine listings\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings last month\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings related to batteries\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Appled improved battery life\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 plus was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for phones\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for tablets\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that phones don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that tablets don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

from the edge of his area , the impression was firm that even the highly improbable can happen . this was quite likely the finest goal of zamora\u2019s long career , a strike of rare quality that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangers\u2019 season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this victory , only a second on the road all season , claws qpr closer to safety . bobby zamora ( left ) scored qpr 's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against west brom at the hawthorns . charlie austin ( right ) headed qpr 's second goal of the game for his team on the 35th minute . the qpr players went 2-0 up thanks to austin and ended up going in 3-0 ahead at half-time .

name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey\u2019s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes . for tony pulis , this was a bad day . his talks with chairman jeremy peace once safety is assured will have to wait . victor anichebe ( left ) headed in a consolation goal for west brom in the 58th after coming off the bench . joey barton ( centre ) added a fourth for qpr in the final minutes of the game against west brom . qpr captain barton celebrates his goal , his team 's fourth , in the game against west brom . youssouff mulumbu was shown a red card for clattering into joey barton , shortly before he scored for his side . barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . \u2018 how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough . green ( left ) makes a save as west brom increased the pressure on qpr after scoring through anichebe . zamora ( left ) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike put them 3-0 up at half time . vargas ( centre ) celebrates with his qpr team-mates after opening the scoring in the 15th minute against west brom . sandro ( right ) makes a sliding challenge against west brom striker saido berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his team\u2019s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris brunt\u2019s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye headed another over . green , the qpr goalkeeper , celebrates his team 's opening goal from vargas . barton ( centre ) has his shirt pulled by craig gardner of west brom in the premier league game .

' under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . he has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . the bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for \u00a32,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . he also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . he said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . henry viii may have been conceived in bed . the carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . it is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . it has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' he added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son . ' look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of christ and mary ; it 's henry viii 's god complex in a nutshell . ' dr foyle described the 15th century artefact , which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in england , as ' a complete national treasure ' . he added : ' evidence suggests the bed was made for the painted chamber of westminster palace for the marriage ceremony at westminster abbey on january 18 , 1486 . ' mr foyle is backed by other experts , such as diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church at oxford university , who described the rediscovery as ' exceptionally important ' . the medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to \u00a320million , although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display . it is part of the ' a bed of roses ' exhibition at the childhood home of anne boleyn , henry viii 's second wife , at hever castle in kent which also features a portrait of henry viii as a young man . the bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in england . in 2013 , the battle-scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in leicester . meanwhile , in december of the same year , archaeologists uncovered a site in the amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of atahualpa , the last emporer of the incas . and last year , explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to alfred the great in the grounds of hyde abbey in winchester . henry vii 's four-poster bed will remain on display in the long gallery at hever castle in kent until november 22 .\n", "reference": "<t> four-poster bed dumped in a hotel car park and sold at auction for # 2,200 . </t> <t> owner suspected it had historic value and experts have been investigating . </t> <t> historian now claims dna from the timber proves it belonged to henry vii . </t> <t> ornate bed , now on display , was made for king and wife elizabeth of york . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Four - poster oak wood bed was dumped in the car park of Redland House Hotel in Hough Green , Chester , by builders who were renovating the property .", "Oblivious to its true value and historical significance , the construction workers dismantled the piece of oak wood furniture and left it to be picked up by auctioneers .", "DNA testing on the bed ' s timber proved it once belonged to King Henry VII , and he traced it to 1495 , when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lancashire ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"A bed was dumped.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"A bed was left in a hotel car park.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed was a four - poster bed.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed sold at auction for 2,200.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Owner suspected it had historic value.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Experts have been investigating.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Historian now claims the bed belonged to Henry VII .\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"DNA from the timber proves who the bed belonged to, it is claimed.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed is ornate.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed is now on display.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed was made for Henry VII / King.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed was also made for Henry VII's wife / King's wife / Elizabeth of York .\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Elizabeth of York was wife of Henry VII / King.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The bed sold at an auction.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}
