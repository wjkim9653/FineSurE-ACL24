' i learnt what i know from reading , websites like youtube , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it . ' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen . ' i can\u2019t help it , it\u2019s like watching tv and if it\u2019s happening in front of you , you can\u2019t help but watch what they do . ' while simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven . the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the wood household lunchboxes can become works of art . he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i\u2019m practising . ' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you\u2019re at my house . ' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it\u2019s in the fridge or freezer it\u2019s likely to come out at some point or another . 'they\u2019re not fussy at all though . they\u2019re like me , there\u2019s nothing i don\u2019t like and that has carried on through to them too . it makes life a lot easier . ' scroll down for video . simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight , he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper . but he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young . the couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam . simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon decided to take up a career in it instead . his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired . he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming . ' it was a moment in all of our lives that we\u2019ll remember and will treasure and look back on . ' simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg wallace , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers ' . simon said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they\u2019re practically idols of yours and you\u2019ve not met them before that . ' then it all starts to get very real very quickly . it\u2019s a daunting prospect that\u2019s in front of you . ' so the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really . ' but simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti-frutti . simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he said : ' you grow so quickly when you\u2019re down there . you get feedback from people that you\u2019d never normally meet and they\u2019re so good at what they do - everyone down there is . ' i got loads of really good feedback down there . i had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves \u2013 i think it showed as well . ' for anyone looking to follow simon 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it . he said : ' if you don\u2019t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you haven\u2019t made something you believe in or enjoyed making . that comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that\u2019s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience . ' if you don\u2019t enjoy it i don\u2019t think your guests will either . ' simon has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster . as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink . he said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did christmas dinner for the first time . ' i had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock . ' i simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock . ' then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i didn\u2019t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on \u2013 think about what you\u2019re doing . ' i don\u2019t think there is anything i can\u2019t cook though . i think i\u2019ve shown throughout the competition that i\u2019m good with most things that get thrown at me . ' simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette . he said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette . ' and if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad . ' nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that\u2019s it \u2013 done . ' just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette . ' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant . for the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie . he said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually \u2013 it\u2019s every cook or chef\u2019s dream . ' if you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing . ' i think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it\u2019s really good . ' i think i\u2019d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist . ' something that looks nice , is achievable . but is also quite opulent and refined and nice . ' also something that isn\u2019t out of everybody\u2019s reach .

' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required .

he\u2019s nowhere to be found except on the birth certificates of a scant five boys last year . waldo actually reached as high as number 347 in 1881 and remained on the list till 1941 , when it became a victim of anti-german sentiment .\n", "reference": "<t> gary fell from 147th most popular british name in 1996 to 1,001 st in 2013 . </t> <t> reached height of its popularity in 1964 , when it was ranked 16th . </t> <t> meanwhile , names including dexter and jenson are now in the top 100 . </t>\n", "sentences": ["just 28 of 700,000 babies born in the uk in 2013 were given the name , data from the office of national statistics shows .", "that compares to 235 garys being born in 1996 , when the name was the 147th most popular in britain .", "in 2013 , it didn't even make the top 1,000 .", "the name peaked in britain roughly decade later .", "in 1964 , it was ranked 16th most popular ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Just 28 babies born in the UK in 2013 were named [name].\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"In 1996, 235 babies named Gary were born, making it the 147th most popular name in Britain.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"In 2013, the name [name] did not make the top 1,000 list of popular names.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The name [name] peaked in popularity in Britain roughly a decade later.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"In 1964, the name [name] was ranked as the 16th most popular name.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 3]}

west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at

zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . \u2018 how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion

half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["sentence dropped : domenico rancadore -lrb- right and left -rrb- fled to britain in the 1990s and was convicted in his absence in italy for his role as a ` man of honour ' .", "but today it emerged that the 65-year-old's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn .", "a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore is a Sicilian mafia fugitive.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore is dubbed the godfather of Uxbridge.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore will be allowed to remain in the UK.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore has lived in Britain for more than 20 years.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was sentenced for being a member of the Cosa Nostra.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired last October.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's European arrest warrant is to be withdrawn.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore is 65 years old.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}

that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangers\u2019 season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this victory , only a second on the road all season , claws qpr closer to safety . bobby zamora ( left ) scored qpr 's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against west brom at the

name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey\u2019s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three

barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . \u2018 how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough .

berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his team\u2019s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris brunt\u2019s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye

{"doc_id": "cnndm307", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "bottom_up_out", "transcript": "( cnn ) the victory of a 72-year-old former general , muhammadu buhari , in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics . buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria 's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ; so many self-described reformers have been . swath . but the peaceful transition of power from president goodluck jonathan to president buhari is the first of its kind in history . and the fact that the winner ran on an anti-corruption platform suggests that ordinary nigerians have finally had enough of the venality of their elites . for too long , nigeria 's poor have been victims of their country 's enormous wealth . the cancer of corruption has to be cut out . i visited nigeria in january and found a country under siege . abuja , the capital city , is where the rich have always imagined themselves making their last stand . soldiers guard the treacherous motorways ; houses are compounds covered in barbed wire . it 's a place where poor children rise at dawn to sift through the trash cans for food and black magic is practiced by the side of the road at dusk . yet thanks to nigeria 's oil , there is also tremendous wealth in abuja . and when you do n't really make money but simply take it from the soil and sell it , a crude kind of crony capitalism develops in which who you know is far more important than what you know . graft trickles down through the system ; through family , through patronage and through shady deals done with foreign businessmen at the 24-hour party palace at the abuja hilton hotel . the richest buy off the anger of the poorest , and vast swaths of society become complicit in the crime . for a while , that system brought some stability to the government of jonathan . but stability was contingent upon oil remaining at $ 110 a barrel , and in recent months the price has collapsed to below $ 50 a barrel . lacking funds , the government could no longer promise jobs to voters and had to start thinking creatively about serious economic development . one was the massive privatization of the power system , a sensible idea that promised to take energy provision out of the hands of a broken state and give it to businessmen to run . the problem is that costly investment and redevelopment did n't come soon enough : millions were left without power and the government 's few bold attempts at reform smacked of betrayal . the problem of corruption went hand-in-glove with the rise of terrorism . nigeria is not a natural , comfortable nation state ; it 's composed of many ethnicities and two major competing religions . the south is dominated by christians like jonathan , the north by muslims like buhari . and the north has witnessed a brutal , bloody terrorist insurgency led by boko haram , which translates as `` western education is forbidden . '' westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . and the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . for buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . the victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . on the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . but he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .\n", "reference": "<t> tim stanley : muhammadu buhar won nigeria vote on campaign against corruption . he 's an ex-dictator , but there 's reason for optimism . </t> <t> he says jonathan administration failed to address corruption , poverty and rise of boko haram . buhar may be tonic to years of misrule . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Nigeria's poor have been victims of their country's wealth , says Buhari Buhari .", "He says Nigeria is the first of its kind in history .", "He says the cancer of corruption has now been cut out ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Buhari Buhari stated that Nigeria's poor have suffered despite the country's wealth\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Buhari Buhari mentioned Nigeria as the first of its kind in history\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Buhari Buhari claimed that corruption has been eradicated\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2]}

but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added .

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings .

' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped .", "domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven - year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .", "but today it emerged that the 65-year - old's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore is a Sicilian mafia fugitive.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore is dubbed the godfather of Uxbridge.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore will be allowed to remain in the UK.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore has lived in Britain for more than 20 years.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was sentenced for being a member of the Cosa Nostra.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired last October.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's European arrest warrant is to be withdrawn.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore is 65 years old.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}
