' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court .

' although she issued an apology on twitter , the sportscaster did not approach michelle directly . the apology : mchenry offered up this note as the video of her awful attack spread online thursday . hundreds of people have reacted to the incident on twitter as espn refuses to comment further . at first , mchenry tweeted insisting she had been in the right . but that post was deleted within hours . employees at the beer hall-cum-chinese-restaurant hunan number one told daily mail online the sports reporter left her car in the parking lot overnight despite clear signs on the door that cars will be towed , warning bar-goers that the restaurant would not be responsible ' if your car is towed from the parking lot ' . the venue , which features ' happy hour ' from 11am until 9pm , was described by enthusiastic patrons as a prime 'pre-game ' spot and online reviewers as a beloved dive bar . hunan number one , offers sushi , hot-wings and other bar food , along with 32oz draft beers for around $ 8 , five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine , served up in front of big screen tvs playing sports . when the bar shuts at 2am , the private towing company , advanced towing , within minutes began removing cars in concurrence with a rule on the private lot . the firm showed magnanimity , saying it did not want mchenry to suffer . in a statement advanced towing said : ' parking enforcement is contentious by nature . at the same time , neither gina , our lot clerk , nor our company , have any interest in seeing britt mchenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments . ' ms mchenry is our neighbor , and , as she said , to paraphrase , made remarks that were out of line . she is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment . ' gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family . gina holds no ill will toward ms mchenry . ' as a small regulated business , we saw no benefit to releasing the video , except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing , public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter .

' what he did was foolish . it must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items .

' the reason he went was because he had been offered a job as it project manager with retail branches in london and zurich . ' he would have been moving away and not able to see his friends . ' the court heard three of the friends who had been on the holiday with armstrong received warnings after batons and knuckle dusters were found in their luggage . mr gatland said the weapons were bought from a ' corner shop ' in cyprus and armstrong had been given the knuckle duster free with his other purchases .\n", "reference": "<t> paul armstrong flew to cyprus to celebrate new job as it project manager . </t> <t> was stopped at airport with stun gun , baton and knuckle duster in his bag . </t> <t> pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and lost his job before starting it . </t> <t> 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months in jail , suspended for two years . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Paul Armstrong , 26 , flew to Cyprus to celebrate his new job as an IT project manager .", "After a spending spree he was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch , extendable baton and Knuckle Duster stuffed in his luggage .", "Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it .", "He was sentenced to eight months imprisonment , suspended for two years , with \u00a3 2 , 000 costs ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong is 26\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong flew to Cyprus\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong had a new job as an IT project manager\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong flew to celebrate his new job\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong had a spending spree\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong was stopped at the airport\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong had a stun gun disguised as a torch\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong had an extendable baton\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong had a Knuckle Duster\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong's weapons were in his luggage\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of two offensive weapons\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong lost his job before he started it\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"The sentence was suspended for two years\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]},\n  {\"key fact\": \"Paul Armstrong was ordered to pay \u00a32,000 in costs\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]}\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}
