but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

' leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . after being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . the singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . but can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . the partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . she even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently . ' everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment . but while andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like the x factor might bring . her debut single , a cover of evanescence 's my immortal , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , dancing in the dark , originally by bruce springsteen , did n't make it any further than 113 . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . if a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . the singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . the glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie . so can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of the voice uk ? his debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year . the scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival t in the park already . stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism . when asked if he 's worried about the growing number of the voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before . ' so now it 's all eyes on you stevie ! no pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than the voice uk . here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from simon cowell 's itv show : one direction they did n't win , in fact they came third , runners up next to matt cardle and rebecca ferguson in 2010 , but simon cowell 's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally , taken over the world with their legion of fans . leona lewis despite having left simon cowell 's label sycon last year , leona remains one of the show 's biggest successes , having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win . jls the runners-up of the 2009 series , jls went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums , before splitting up in 2013 . olly murs he came second to joe mcelderry in 2009 , then went on to sell almost as many albums as jls and co-present the x factor 's sister show xtra factor in itv2 with caroline flack . alexandra burke after winning the 2009 series following her duet with beyonce , alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single hallelujah . james arthur before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile twitter rants , he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single impossible after winning the 2012 series . little mix the first ever group to win the show in 2011 , little mix have now beaten the spice girls ' chart success in america and raked up an impressive 132million vevo views . rebecca ferguson though she came second to matt cardle in the 2010 series , rebecca has just released her third album lady sings the blues and has enjoyed steady chart success .\n", "reference": "<t> leanne mitchell has been dropped by her label and sings at a holiday camp . </t> <t> andrea begley and jermain jackman are yet to become household names . </t> <t> will 2015 winner stevie become a chart success or another voice flop ? </t>\n", "sentences": ["Stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of The Voice UK 2015 .", "Mentor Ricky Wilson , his fellow Celebrity Judges Rita Ora , Tom Jones and will.i.am will.i.am will.i.am , and most of all bosses at the BBC will all have their fingers crossed for his success .", "It's not just a hit single Stevie Needs , he also has to break the curse of previous winners who have failed to do anything but flop out of the charts ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Leanne Mitchell has been dropped by her label\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Leanne Mitchell sings at a holiday camp\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Andrea Begley is yet to become a household name\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Jermain Jackman is yet to become a household name\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Stevie won in 2015\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Will Stevie become a chart success?\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Will Stevie become another voice flop?\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1]}
{"doc_id": "cnndm8815", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "two_stage_rl_out", "transcript": "simon wood , 38 , from oldham won masterchef last friday . wannabe chefs with their eye on a career as the next gordon ramsay or jamie oliver should take note - it doesn't have to cost a fortune . the new winner of masterchef simon wood , who won the title last friday , has n't been on a single cookery course or even had one lesson . everything the 38 year old knows about cooking is self-taught - learnt form reading recipe books or watching television shows . he told mailonline : 'it\u2019s all self-taught . there\u2019s no more to it than that . you can achieve anything if you try hard enough and you\u2019re passionate enough . ' i learnt what i know from reading , websites like youtube , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it . ' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen . ' i can\u2019t help it , it\u2019s like watching tv and if it\u2019s happening in front of you , you can\u2019t help but watch what they do . ' while simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven . the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the wood household lunchboxes can become works of art . he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i\u2019m practising . ' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you\u2019re at my house . ' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it\u2019s in the fridge or freezer it\u2019s likely to come out at some point or another . 'they\u2019re not fussy at all though . they\u2019re like me , there\u2019s nothing i don\u2019t like and that has carried on through to them too . it makes life a lot easier . ' scroll down for video . simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight , he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper . but he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young . the couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam . simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon decided to take up a career in it instead . his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired . he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming . ' it was a moment in all of our lives that we\u2019ll remember and will treasure and look back on . ' simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg wallace , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers ' . simon said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they\u2019re practically idols of yours and you\u2019ve not met them before that . ' then it all starts to get very real very quickly . it\u2019s a daunting prospect that\u2019s in front of you . ' so the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really . ' but simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti-frutti . simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he said : ' you grow so quickly when you\u2019re down there . you get feedback from people that you\u2019d never normally meet and they\u2019re so good at what they do - everyone down there is . ' i got loads of really good feedback down there . i had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves \u2013 i think it showed as well . ' for anyone looking to follow simon 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it . he said : ' if you don\u2019t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you haven\u2019t made something you believe in or enjoyed making . that comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that\u2019s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience . ' if you don\u2019t enjoy it i don\u2019t think your guests will either . ' simon has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster . as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink . he said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did christmas dinner for the first time . ' i had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock . ' i simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock . ' then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i didn\u2019t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on \u2013 think about what you\u2019re doing . ' i don\u2019t think there is anything i can\u2019t cook though . i think i\u2019ve shown throughout the competition that i\u2019m good with most things that get thrown at me . ' simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette . he said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette . ' and if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad . ' nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that\u2019s it \u2013 done . ' just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette . ' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant . for the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie . he said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually \u2013 it\u2019s every cook or chef\u2019s dream . ' if you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing . ' i think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it\u2019s really good . ' i think i\u2019d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist . ' something that looks nice , is achievable . but is also quite opulent and refined and nice . ' also something that isn\u2019t out of everybody\u2019s reach .

never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangers\u2019 season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this

name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey\u2019s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes . for tony pulis , this was a bad day . his talks with chairman jeremy peace once safety is assured will have to wait . victor anichebe ( left )

barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . \u2018 how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough .

half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris brunt\u2019s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Domenico Rancadore , 65 , fled to Britain in the 1990s to join the Sicilian Mafia .", "He was convicted in his absence in Italy for his role as a ' Man of Honour ' .", "In February he was set to be extradited to Italy and sentenced to seven years .", "But today it emerged that his case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore given a sentence.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced for 7 years.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced by Italian court.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced in 1999.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was convicted for role as Man of Honour.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore took bribes from builders.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a Sicilian Mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore lost battle against extradition to Italy.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Today a news emerged.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a 65 year old.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired in October last year.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [4]\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4]}
