'' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\n", "reference": "<t> attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it . </t> <t> harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used . </t> <t> in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates , 73 , says he meant to use his stun gun but fired his handgun instead .", "Experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer's dominant side of the body , and the Taser on the nondominant side .", "Bates ' attorney says his client is left - handed , but the reserve deputy said his gun was on his right side .", "In 2009 , a Bay Area Rapid Transit police officer fired his gun instead of his Taser , killing 22-year - old Oscar Grant ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates made an assumption.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates assumed the gun is a taser because Bates saw a laser sight on the gun.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Harris family lawyers say there are differences between the gun and Taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California made a statement in 2009.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he mistakenly used his gun.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he used his gun instead of a taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates thought the gun was a Taser.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

' there are a few things i 've missed out on , but i do n't feel like i 've missed out i 've made the best of the situation , ' she said . the basketballer , who lives in canberra , has looked after her niece since she was two days old . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams .

'' westerners might assume that boko haram 's major target is the christian south but , in fact , its war is as much against nonfundamentalist muslims as it is non-muslims , and its attacks have generally been focused on islamic population centers . failure to deal with this has not entirely been due to boko haram 's strategic ingenuity . previous administrations have simply been too dysfunctional to fight a war on terror . in 2010 , for instance , the government awarded a $ 470 million contract to provide security in abuja . few of the promised cameras were installed , yet the money was still paid in full . and soldiers sent to the front report being poorly equipped . the government is thought to have resorted to trying to purchase arms on the international black market , according to news reports -- although this is the kind of story that is hard to verify due to bans on granting visas to foreign journalists ( i was in nigeria as a consultant on a business visa ) . what is directly observable is that while the government proved capable of providing security in some areas , in others it utterly failed . and the jonathan government might have benefited from the boko haram terrorist emergency continuing in muslim centers , for the muslims were far more likely to vote for buhari . for buhari to win , he had to draw large numbers of votes in christian areas -- and there , again , a western prejudice is challenged . the victory of a muslim candidate in nigeria does not represent the victory of islamism , as we have so often been told by those skeptical of the ability of the muslim world to govern itself . on the contrary , buhari is associated with an earlier period in nigerian history when the army was relatively well paid and respected . he ran the country in the early 1980s along dictatorial lines , for sure . but he also ran a war against indiscipline when in power in which civil servants who were late to work were ordered to do frog jumps , drug dealers were publicly executed , and some 474 politicians and business were arrested on charges of corruption . buhari was removed in a coup , and he left office with the rare distinction of not having made very much money from it . now he has won the presidency promising to tackle those intertwined problems of boko haram and corruption . get the army functioning properly again , nigerians hope , and it will be able to drive back the fundamentalists . buhari has his critics , many of whom charge him with misrepresenting his cv and being a closet authoritarian . but they can not deny that he has won this historic victory because he has touched a chord with a people exhausted by years of misrule . you can only bribe the voters for so long before the squalor becomes too much to bear .\n", "reference": "<t> tim stanley : muhammadu buhar won nigeria vote on campaign against corruption . he 's an ex-dictator , but there 's reason for optimism . </t> <t> he says jonathan administration failed to address corruption , poverty and rise of boko haram . buhar may be tonic to years of misrule . </t>\n", "sentences": ["-lrb- cnn -rrb- the victory of a 72-year-old former general , muhammadu buhari , in the nigerian elections represents a moment of maturity in west african politics .", "buhari , who some 30 years ago was nigeria's harsh military leader , could of course prove to be a disaster ;

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped .", "domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven - year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .", "but today it emerged that the 65-year - old's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore given a sentence.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced for 7 years.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced by Italian court.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced in 1999.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was convicted for role as Man of Honour.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore took bribes from builders.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a Sicilian Mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore lost battle against extradition to Italy.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Today a news emerged.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a 65 year old.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired in October last year.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}

' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' he added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gang\u2019s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ?

it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["carl froch -lrb- left -rrb- has not fought since beating george groves at wembley last may .", "froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7lbs - despite being away from the ring for nearly a year now .", "froch had hoped to meet julio cesar chavez jr , but he lost to andrzej fonfara last week ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"If Carl Froch doesn't fight in 2015 I 'm not sure he 'll be back at all .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr defeat\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Anthony Dirrell has made contact .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Scott Quigg - Carl Frampton Summer Fight Is Dead in the water .\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary .

'' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence .

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey\u2019s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three

barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . \u2018 how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough .

berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his team\u2019s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris brunt\u2019s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than \u20ac10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy for his role as a ` Man of Honour ' .", "The 65 - year - old's case expired last October and his European Arrest Warrant is to be withdrawn .", "His conviction remains intact , Italian law states that a sentence is extinguished once a period of more than double the time of the penalty has passed .", "Rancadore's solicitor Karen Todner said : ` there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and I am delighted Mr Rancadore will now be able to live in peace in England with his wife and Family ' ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore given a sentence.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced for 7 years.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced by Italian court.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore sentenced in 1999.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was convicted for role as Man of Honour.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [1, 3]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore took bribes from builders.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a Sicilian Mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore lost battle against extradition to Italy.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Today a news emerged.\",\n    \"response\": \"No\",\n    \"line number\": []\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore was a 65 year old.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  },\n  {\n    \"key fact\": \"Domenico Rancadore's case expired in October last year.\",\n    \"response\": \"Yes\",\n    \"line number\": [2]\n  }\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

' i 'd just taken on a baby that was n't mine and they were n't as understanding as all my other teams have been .

' bishop is glad she will be able to take zala with her when she goes to the u.s. to play with the seattle storm in may . ' in seattle their rules in terms of contracts are very strict but in their own little way they have helped me , ' she said . bishop said zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot . ' the plane trips are always the tricky part , just because she 's so active , but in terms of being over there she loves it , ' bishop said . bishop has had to make a lot of adjustments to her life \u2013 including getting used to a lack of sleep . \u2018 i think the biggest thing was it wasn\u2019t all about me anymore , my life turned to being about this little human\u2019 . ' everyone loves her and treats her like she 's part of the team . ' she loves the attention - all they like is attention at that age . ' bishop has had to make a lot of adjustments to her life \u2013 including getting used to a lack of sleep and the fact that she is now responsible for someone else 's life . ' i think the biggest thing was it was n't all about me anymore , my life turned to being about this little human , ' she said . ' and just for social things , my friends say `` let 's go out for dinner or drinks '' and i have to say `` nah sorry i ca n't i 've got a child now .

' under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . he has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . the bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for \u00a32,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . he also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . he said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . henry viii may have been conceived in bed . the carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . it is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . it has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' he added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son .

' my sister wasn\u2019t very well , ' she told daily mail australia . ' i pretty much brought zala home and started pre-season training with the canberra capitals straight away . ' it was tough with no sleep and adjusting to having another little human with me 24/7 , but i have amazing friends who help me and my mum helped me when she could . ' i 'm not going to lie and say it was easy but i just got through it . ' bishop had planned to spend a few years living in europe full-time playing basketball , but she had to adjust her plans to do what was best for zala . she chose to base herself in canberra , sometimes flying interstate with zala for weekend matches . bishop was also able to take zala with her to hungary , where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in february 2014 and again in february this year . ' there are a few things i 've missed out on , but i do n't feel like i 've missed out i 've made the best of the situation , ' she said . the basketballer , who lives in canberra , has looked after her niece since she was two days old . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams .
