from the edge of his area , the impression was firm that even the highly improbable can happen . this was quite likely the finest goal of zamora\u2019s long career , a strike of rare quality that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangers\u2019 season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this victory , only a second on the road all season , claws qpr closer to safety . bobby zamora ( left ) scored qpr 's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against west brom at the hawthorns . charlie austin ( right ) headed qpr 's second goal of the game for his team on the 35th minute . the qpr players went 2-0 up thanks to austin and ended up going in 3-0 ahead at half-time .

name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu\u2019s act in retribution for barton\u2019s claims albion players had \u2018s***\u2019 themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey\u2019s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes . for tony pulis , this was a bad day . his talks with chairman jeremy peace once safety is assured will have to wait . victor anichebe ( left ) headed in a consolation goal for west brom in the 58th after coming off the bench . joey barton ( centre ) added a fourth for qpr in the final minutes of the game against west brom . qpr captain barton celebrates his goal , his team 's fourth , in the game against west brom . youssouff mulumbu was shown a red card for clattering into joey barton , shortly before he scored for his side . barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . \u2018 how s*** must you be , we\u2019re winning away , \u2019 sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough . green ( left ) makes a save as west brom increased the pressure on qpr after scoring through anichebe . zamora ( left ) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike put them 3-0 up at half time . vargas ( centre ) celebrates with his qpr team-mates after opening the scoring in the 15th minute against west brom . sandro ( right ) makes a sliding challenge against west brom striker saido berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his team\u2019s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for

' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required .

' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gang\u2019s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ? the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company\u2019s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . loot smuggled out of the country ? some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be \u2018 a doddle\u2019 . what about the \u2018 king of diamonds\u2019 ? a criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . the panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with \u00a313million worth of jewellery .\n", "reference": "<t> locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist . </t> <t> they also tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises on evening of good friday . </t> <t> group seen returning to scene on saturday - a day after initial break-in . </t> <t> police admit they did n't respond after alarm went off early on friday . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Two members of the criminal gang , with their faces obscured , can be seen entering the building .", "Thieves returned a day after the robbery in Central London .", "Residents on Greville Street say they had suspicious power outages a week before the heist .", "Scotland Yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene .", "They claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of Good Friday .", "They exit the building with Wheelies Bins thought to be carrying the stolen loot .", "Residents living yards from the scene of the # 60million Hatton Garden Heist ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"There were power cuts the weekend before the raid\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Locals say power cuts could be linked to heist.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Locals tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [5]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Locals tell of noises on evening of Good Friday.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [5]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Group was seen returning to scene.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Group was seen on Saturday.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The day after initial break - in was Saturday.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Police admit they didn't respond after alarm went off.\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [4]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The alarm went off early on Friday.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [2, 3, 4, 5]}

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Fan site Appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on Apple ' s official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .", "These include listings for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer , a Software Power Systems Engineer , battery pack engineering manager and a Cell Engineer .", "This includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30 - minute workout with music ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted nine listings\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings last month\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appleinsider spotted listings related to batteries\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The listings include one for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Appled improved battery life\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The battery life of iphone 6 plus was improved\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for phones\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Apple has been criticized for tablets\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that phones don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The criticism includes that tablets don't last a day\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2]}

' my sister wasn\u2019t very well , ' she told daily mail australia . ' i pretty much brought zala home and started pre-season training with the canberra capitals straight away . ' it was tough with no sleep and adjusting to having another little human with me 24/7 , but i have amazing friends who help me and my mum helped me when she could . ' i 'm not going to lie and say it was easy but i just got through it . ' bishop had planned to spend a few years living in europe full-time playing basketball , but she had to adjust her plans to do what was best for zala . she chose to base herself in canberra , sometimes flying interstate with zala for weekend matches . bishop was also able to take zala with her to hungary , where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in february 2014 and again in february this year . ' there are a few things i 've missed out on , but i do n't feel like i 've missed out i 've made the best of the situation , ' she said . the basketballer , who lives in canberra , has looked after her niece since she was two days old . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams . ' all the teams i 've been part of have just been amazing in terms of taking me and zala on . ' my european teams paid for my nanny 's flights and they had cots and car seats and toys and everything there . ' i just ca n't thank the canberra capitals enough for putting childcare in my contract and letting me take zala on road trips . ' but it has n't all been smooth sailing . bishop had to miss out on playing for the national opals team in the world championships in turkey in october last year because of issues with their policy , which would have required her to cover the cost of travelling with a nanny . ' taking on zala i knew i was going to have to deal with some things within sport and for me that was not being able to go to world championships because of the policy they put in place , ' she said . bishop was able to take zala with her to hungary , where she played for local basketball teams for a couple of months in february 2014 and again in february this year . bishop said zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot . they are pictured here together in hungary . zala will go with bishop to the u.s. this may when she starts playing for the seattle storm in the wnba . ' i 'd just taken on a baby that was n't mine and they were n't as understanding as all my other teams have been . ' i understand it 's the highest level , playing for australia , but it 's a unique situation and needs to be looked at differently than another mother 's situation with a husband and a biological child . ' bishop is glad she will be able to take zala with her when she goes to the u.s. to play with the seattle storm in may . ' in seattle their rules in terms of contracts are very strict but in their own little way they have helped me , ' she said . bishop said zala loves travelling and acting as team mascot .

{"doc_id": "cnndm19", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "two_stage_rl_out", "transcript": "( cnn ) on the surface , the mix-up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! i shot him . i 'm sorry , '' bates said in a video of the shooting . but it 's happened before . in a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . the former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , '' bates said in a written statement to investigators . after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , '' said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , '' brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . '' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland ( of oscar grant ) , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors ( yellow or black ) , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\n", "reference": "<t> attorney : robert bates assumed the gun was a taser because he saw a laser sight on it . </t> <t> harris family lawyers say there are stark differences between the gun and taser used . </t> <t> in 2009 , an officer in california also said he mistakenly used his gun instead of a taser . </t>\n", "sentences": ["A reserve deputy killed Eric Harris in Tulsa , Oklahoma , in 2009 .", "Law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer ' s dominant side ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates made an assumption.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates assumed the gun is a taser because Bates saw a laser sight on the gun.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Harris family lawyers say there are differences between the gun and Taser.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"An officer in California made a statement in 2009.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he mistakenly used his gun.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"An officer in California also said he used his gun instead of a taser.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"An attorney says Robert Bates thought the gun was a Taser.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

'' about five miles away , the wall of koirala 's hiv/aids hospice has crumbled . home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard . `` they 're not injured , but they are terrified , '' koirala said . `` everything is broken in the hospice . '' koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged . `` it 's really very sad for me and for my children , '' koirala said . `` this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it . i was not afraid that i was going to be killed . i was afraid about what is going to happen next . '' another cnn hero , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence . they are now living on the ground in a nearby field . `` physically , we are not hurt . but mentally , we are , '' said basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated . basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down . she and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves . `` it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , '' basnet said . `` we are really scared . '' they also do n't have much water or food , basnet says . but she is trying to stay positive . `` i think for the time being , whatever we have , we should be happy , you know ? because at least we have our life , '' she said . `` ( my kids ) all are safe . that 's the most important thing for me . '' basnet 's `` butterfly home '' -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake . basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october . basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 hero of the year . `` when the earthquake hit that land , all my dreams were scattered , '' she said . `` i have to restart again . '' still , basnet is quick to point out that so many other survivors have nothing and are desperately in need of aid . to that end , several cnn heroes have been assisting in relief efforts in nepal . jake wood 's disaster relief organization , team rubicon , has a team of experienced veterans and first responders on the ground in kathmandu . the group deployed a medical and assessment team to aid the nepalese people in several remote villages outside of the city . six canine-firefighter search teams from the united states also assisted in rescue and recovery efforts . the teams were trained by wilma melville 's national disaster search dog foundation and were deployed as part of a larger rescue force that includes structural engineers , hazmat experts and doctors . tom henderson 's shelterbox , which provides emergency shelter and lifesaving supplies , has so far committed to help more than 15,000 families . dr. laura stachel 's group , we care solar , sent solar suitcases to health care workers , providing them with light and power as they aid survivors . arlene samen 's group , one heart world-wide , has set up tented birthing centers where pregnant women can safely deliver their babies , especially in hard-hit districts . robin lim , a disaster response midwife who founded bumi sehat , joined samen in kathmandu to help the mothers . doc hendley 's nonprofit , wine to water , partnered with appalachian state university in order to distribute 1,000 water filters where they are most needed in nepal . the group says one filter can provide water for up to 10 people and last for up to 10 years if maintained properly .\n", "reference": "<t> anuradha koirala and 425 young women and girls have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks . </t> <t> pushpa basnet and 45 children she cares for were forced to evacuate their residence . </t> <t> seven other cnn heroes and their organizations now assisting in relief efforts . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Two CNN Heroes are among the earthquake survivors in Kathmandu , Nepal .", "Anuradha Koirala , who rescues victims of sex trafficking , has a rehabilitation center in Kathmandu .", "Pushpa Basnet and the 45 children she cares for were forced to evacuate their residence ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"Anuradha Koirala has been sleeping outdoors\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"425/many young women and girls have been sleeping outdoors\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Many people have been sleeping outdoors because of aftershocks\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Pushpa Basnet was forced to evacuate her residence\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Pushpa Basnet cares for 45 children\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The children were forced to evacuate their residence\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [3]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Anuradha Koirala was a CNN Hero\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [2]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Pushpa Basnet was a CNN Hero\", \"response\": \"Yes\", \"line number\": [1]},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Seven other CNN Heros were now assisting relief efforts\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"The organizations of CNN Heros were now assisting relief efforts\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": [1, 2, 3]}

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team \u00a31.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Carl Froch has not fought since beating George Groves .", "Froch has kept in shape and weighs 12st 7 lbs .", "Froch had hoped to meet Julio Cesar Chavez Jr .", "Anthony Dirrell's IBF world title fight against James degale is the biggest bout of this trio .", "Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lose at the weekend .", "The winner could be a winner for the first time since the World Cup ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "```json\n[\n    {\"key fact\": \"If Carl Froch doesn't fight in 2015 I 'm not sure he 'll be back at all.\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"A blockbuster with James degale is most likely after Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr defeat\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Anthony Dirrell has made contact .\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []},\n    {\"key fact\": \"Scott Quigg - Carl Frampton Summer Fight Is Dead in the water .\", \"response\": \"No\", \"line number\": []}\n]\n```", "pred_alignment_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "pred_sentence_line_numbers": []}

but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly -

but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

' there are a few things i 've missed out on , but i do n't feel like i 've missed out i 've made the best of the situation , ' she said . the basketballer , who lives in canberra , has looked after her niece since she was two days old . now zala is 20 months old and she follows bishop as she travels the world playing for professional teams .
