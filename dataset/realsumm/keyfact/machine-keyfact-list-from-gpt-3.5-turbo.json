'' about five miles away , the wall of koirala 's hiv/aids hospice has crumbled . home to 115 girls , many of whom are terminally ill , the facility is under guard . `` they 're not injured , but they are terrified , '' koirala said . `` everything is broken in the hospice . '' koirala 's group also has about a dozen other homes throughout the district , and all of them have been damaged . `` it 's really very sad for me and for my children , '' koirala said . `` this disaster , the noise and the way it shook , i can not get over it . i was not afraid that i was going to be killed . i was afraid about what is going to happen next . '' another cnn hero , pushpa basnet , and the 45 children she cares for were also forced to evacuate their residence . they are now living on the ground in a nearby field . `` physically , we are not hurt . but mentally , we are , '' said basnet , whose early childhood development center provides a home and education to children whose parents are incarcerated . basnet says the building 's walls are all cracked , and the staff is afraid it might fall down . she and the older children created a shelter using the frame of a greenhouse , taping plastic around the sides to protect themselves . `` it 's really cold in the middle of the night ; there are lots of fox in the field , '' basnet said . `` we are really scared .

'' basnet 's `` butterfly home '' -- the permanent residence she was building for the children -- also suffered extensive damage in the quake . basnet had hoped to complete construction in the next six months , with the opening ceremony set for october . basnet purchased the land for the home with prize money she received as the 2012 hero of the year . `` when the earthquake hit that land , all my dreams were scattered , '' she said . `` i have to restart again .

the city 's inchicore suburb . black widow catherine nevin leaving mountjoy prison as she walks to get a bus . an unsuspecting commuter sat next to her as she made her way through the city centre and to her course in the suburbs . catherine and tom nevin on their wedding day . the 62-year-old was given life in prison for arranging to have her husband shot dead . she walked through the city centre to dorset street where she waited for a bus before attending the addiction studies course . ireland 's most infamous woman prisoner went largely unnoticed as she took the bus unaccompanied after leaving prison - with an unsuspecting female commuter sitting down next to her - according the daily mirror . catherine nevin leaving the central criminal court in dublin during her trial in 2000 . dressed in jeans , a blue fleece top and a pair of black ugg boots , nevin took in sights she has n't seen since being jailed 15 years ago . she laughed and joked with a pal for more than an hour at the nearby applegreen garage before her course started . she failed last july to have her conviction overturned , though this outing will fuel speculation a full release from jail is imminent . her temporary release is understood to have been approved by the parole board and sanctioned by the justice minister . the course is part of her pre-release plan to help her integrate back into society once freed . nevin 's current study leave is her latest educational placement after she studied the same topic at the mounttown community facility in dun laoghaire last october . while attending that course , run by the dun laoghaire rathdown drugs task force , she was always accompanied by prison warders . completion of the course gives participants a fetac level 5 addiction studies certificate . it 's believed that as well as attending the course in inchicore , nevin has also been using facilities at maynooth university in co kildare and trinity college over the past few weeks . while in

serving life for murder , regarded her as a close friend in jail . despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate . tom nevin was shot dead in the couple 's pub , jack white 's inn , in brittas bay , co wicklow , in march 1996 . his wife was also convicted of soliciting three men – gerry heapes , william mcclean and john jones – to kill him . despite her high-profile conviction she has never taken responsibility for her role in the murder of tom and is also still fighting for a share in his substantial estate . her trial was shrouded in controversy and has gone down in history as the longest ever murder trial in the history of ireland . the trial and media coverage of

it is life-changing money for frampton that has been offered . let’s hope they don’t spend the rest of their lives kicking themselves . scott will move on and fight on july 18 . i can guarantee that in his next fight he will fight a tougher opponent than frampton will . scott quigg ( right , in action against hidenori othake ) will fight on july 18 against an unnamed opponent . carl frampton 's team failed to make an offer to fight quigg , according to his promoter hearn . hearn went live on sky sports to offer frampton and his team £1.5m to fight quigg . anthony joshua has been added to my may 9 show in birmingham , where he will fight rafael zumbano love , the south american champion . he is 6ft 4ins and this will be a good test for anthony against a big man before he then has his 02 fight against kevin johnson on may 30 . we are keeping him busy , which is what he wants . i saw him in the gym this week and he is looking awesome . after the johnson fight he will be out again on july 18 in manchester and then in september in a big fight . watch this space . anthony joshua ( left ) beat jason gavern ( right ) last time out and will now face rafael zumbano love .\n", "reference": "<t> if carl froch does n't fight in 2015 i 'm not sure he 'll be back at all . </t> <t> a blockbuster with james degale is most likely after julio cesar chavez jnr defeat - but anthony dirrell has made contact . </t> <t> scott quigg-carl frampton summer fight is dead in the water . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Carl Froch has not fought since beating George Groves at Wembley last May .", "Froch had hoped to meet Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr , but he lost to Andrzej Fonfara last week .", "I have held talks with Gennady Golovkin's manager and there is also the possibility of Bernard Hopkins .", "I think Froch needs to fight again in 2015 if he is to ever return ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [0, 0, 0, 1]}, "3": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Carl Froch's last fight was against George Groves at Wembley last May\",\n    \"Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lost to Andrzej Fonfara last week\",\n    \"Talks have been held with Gennady Golovkin's manager\",\n    \"There is a possibility of fighting Bernard Hopkins\",\n    \"Froch may need to fight again in 2015 to make a return\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Carl Froch's last fight was against George Groves at Wembley last May", "Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr lost to Andrzej Fonfara last week", "Talks have been held with Gennady Golovkin's manager", "There is a possibility of fighting Bernard Hopkins", "Froch may need to fight again in 2015 to make a return"]}
