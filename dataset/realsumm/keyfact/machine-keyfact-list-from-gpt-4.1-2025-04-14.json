' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than €10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .", "a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped .", "in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Domenico Rancadore has lived in Britain for more than 20 years.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was sentenced for being a member of the Cosa Nostra.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore is a Sicilian mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore will be allowed to remain in the UK.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore's sentence was dropped.\",\n    \"In February, Domenico Rancadore lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence.\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Domenico Rancadore has lived in Britain for more than 20 years.", "Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999.", "Domenico Rancadore was sentenced for being a member of the Cosa Nostra.", "Domenico Rancadore is a Sicilian mafia fugitive.", "Domenico Rancadore was dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge.", "Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy.", "Domenico Rancadore will be allowed to remain in the UK.", "Domenico Rancadore's sentence was dropped.", "In February, Domenico Rancadore lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition.", "Domenico Rancadore was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence."]}

but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

' i learnt what i know from reading , websites like youtube , watching tv and talking to people who are also passionate about it . ' i also found out a lot from watching chefs when i go to a restaurant - you go into a lot of restaurants these days and you can see straight into the kitchen . ' i can’t help it , it’s like watching tv and if it’s happening in front of you , you can’t help but watch what they do . ' while simon , who lives in oldham , learns about his cooking from reading and watching programmes , he sharpens his skills by practicing on his four children - liam , 20 , alex , 18 , cameron , 16 , and charlotte , seven . the lucky children are often on the receiving end of their father 's culinary masterpieces - in the wood household lunchboxes can become works of art . he said : ' they only get fancy stuff in their lunch boxes when i’m practising . ' all of my kids like different things , so it can be like a gourmet buffet sometimes when you’re at my house . ' everyone wants something different , someone wants fish , and someone else wants shellfish - if it’s in the fridge or freezer it’s likely to come out at some point or another . 'they’re not fussy at all though . they’re like me , there’s nothing i don’t like and that has carried on through to them too . it makes life a lot easier . ' scroll down for video . simon has always wanted to be a chef - when he was eight , he won the opportunity to spend a day in a hotel kitchen and featured in the local newspaper . but he gave up his dream because he and his wife , who he separated from two years ago , had a child very young . the couple met while working at mcdonalds and when he was just 19 , they had their first child - liam . simon as an eight year old after winning the chance to spend a day in a hotel kitchen . the hours that chefs do are notoriously antisocial and so simon decided to take up a career in it instead . his children are over the moon that their father is now following his dream though and they watched the masterchef final on tv together last friday , when they learnt for the first time that their father had won - because it had to be kept a secret until the programme aired . he said : ' when we watched it together , it was the first time that they found out i had won and it was emotional , it was pretty overwhelming . ' it was a moment in all of our lives that we’ll remember and will treasure and look back on . ' simon has come a long way since the beginning of the show - in the first episode he was so terrified that greg wallace , who is one of the judges on the show , pointed out that he was actually ' shaking in his trainers ' . simon said : ' when you first go in there on day one , when you see john and greg for the first time , they’re practically idols of yours and you’ve not met them before that . ' then it all starts to get very real very quickly . it’s a daunting prospect that’s in front of you . ' so the next hour and 15 minutes that you get in there can determine the rest of your life really . ' but simon managed to overcome his nerves and was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he won the final with a starter of octopus , with chorizo crisps and a cannellini bean and chorizo salad ; his main course was pigeon with carrots , pommes parisienne and a cassis jus ; and for the pudding he produced a lemon posset , with citrus tutti-frutti . simon was noted as one of the contestants who had grown the most over the course of the show . he said : ' you grow so quickly when you’re down there . you get feedback from people that you’d never normally meet and they’re so good at what they do - everyone down there is . ' i got loads of really good feedback down there . i had a really good competition when i found my confidence and got rid of my nerves – i think it showed as well . ' for anyone looking to follow simon 's success , he has one simple tip - enjoy it . he said : ' if you don’t enjoy it , it shows in the food that you haven’t made something you believe in or enjoyed making . that comes out on the plate and ultimately for your guests or whoever is eating the meal and that’s no good because food is about passion and giving people a valuable experience . ' if you don’t enjoy it i don’t think your guests will either . ' simon has n't always been this good , even masterchef winner 's have the occasional cooking disaster . as a young man , he learnt the hazards of absent-minded cooking after he tipped and entire stock he had worked on for hours down the sink . he said : ' my biggest disaster was when i was younger and first started out cooking , i did christmas dinner for the first time . ' i had a big turkey carcass so thought i was going to make a really nice stock . ' i simmered it for hours and hours and made a really good stock . ' then i went to drain all of the vegetables and the bones out and ended up pouring it all down the sink because i didn’t put something under it , that was a lesson i learnt really early on – think about what you’re doing . ' i don’t think there is anything i can’t cook though . i think i’ve shown throughout the competition that i’m good with most things that get thrown at me . ' simon is now hoping to open a restaurant of his own . while he enjoys fancy cooking , one of the simplest culinary pleasures for simon is a meal that can be rustled up in under ten minutes - a plain omelette . he said : ' the first thing i ever cooked as a child was an omelette . ' and if i 'm looking for something quick and easy to do , i still always go back to an omelette and a glass of wine , with a salad . ' nothing in it , just some sea salt and a really good salad with it , that’s it – done . ' just nice and simple , good eggs , good omelette . ' but anyone looking to sample some of the cooking that netted simon the masterchef prize can expect something much more intricate when he succeeds in his dream of opening his own restaurant . for the time being he is going back to the it company he worked for , but his eye is already on setting up his own eaterie . he said : ' i am definitely planning on having a restaurant eventually – it’s every cook or chef’s dream . ' if you can make money doing something you love and enjoy it and help people create memories then that is amazing . ' i think a lot of people remember where they were when they had a good meal with special people at special times - if you can get involved with that by having a restaurant , it’s really good . ' i think i’d want to do classic dishes with a modern twist . ' something that looks nice , is achievable . but is also quite opulent and refined and nice . ' also something that isn’t out of everybody’s reach .

' between 1996 and 2013 , unusual names such as dexter ( there were 1,019 born in 2013 ) , jenson ( 1,055 ) and harley ( 1,275 ) all climbed in popularity to break the top 100 . meanwhile , the country went from having no girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . nearly 200 were born in 2013 . other names inspired by famous faces including rihanna ( 60 born in 2013 ) , hermione ( 77 ) and paris ( 107 ) were also more popular than humble gary . data from last year shows a surge in arabic names in the uk , with omar , ali and ibrahim all entering the boys’ top 100 for the first time . for girls , maryam has shot up 59 places to number 35 , while nur is a new entry in the girls’ top 100 , jumping straight to number 29 . and muhammad has risen an astonishing 27 places compared to last year to claim the number-one spot for boys . sophia was the top name for baby girls but the year’s biggest riser within the girls’ top 100 was maryam , while the highest new entries were nur , emilia and gracie . for baby boys , teddy was the biggest climber within the top 100 . the highest new entry was kian . popular : between 1996 and 2013 country went from having no baby girls called harper - the name given to david and victoria beckham 's daughter - to hundreds . above , harper with her brothers and father last month . girls . alpha - alpha may be the first letter in the greek alphabet , but it’s one of the last names modern parents consider for their baby girls . not so in 1880 , the first year baby name records were kept in the us , when alpha was number 301 . it dropped off the top 1000 in 1944 and is about to disappear for good . barbra - singer barbra streisand made her unusually-spelled , condensed name famous in the 1960s , when it peaked at number 511 , only to drop off in the top 1000 in 1971 . barbara , a top 10 name for three decades , hangs on in the top 1000 , but barbra is about to vanish . claudine - this feminization of the ancient roman name claudius ranked in the top 1000 for first half of the 20th century , then blipped to a new height in 1970 on the popularity of singer claudine longet , only to fall off the charts in 1975 . claudine along with most other once-popular –ine and –een-ending girls’ names are now out of favor . nanette - nanette ranked among the top 1000 until 77 , peaking in 1956 . but today , most parents say no to nanette . sheba - sheba is the short form of the biblical bathsheba , disappearing from view with only five baby girls named sheba in the us in 2013 . sondra - sandra’s exotic sister sondra ranked in the top 1000 from the 1920s through the 80s , peaking in 1939 . but the devastating hurricane sandy took a lot of wind out of all forms of this name , given to only five girls in 2013 . thisbe -thisbe was never ranked in the top 1000 , but this ancient mythological name – she was a doomed young lover whose tale inspired romeo & juliet – is about to vanish from the modern lexicon . zelma - zelma nearly broke the top 200 in 1902 but fell off the list in 1955 . selma , thelma , and even velma , might be hanging on by the tips of their antiquated fingernails , but zelma is about to lose her grip on modern usage . boys . elmo - just over a century ago , this short form of guglielmo , the italian form of william , stood at a respectable number 247 , hanging in there until the 1950s , when it disappeared from view . any hope of revival was shattered by the ticklish toy from sesamestreet . icarus - a dramatic greek mythological name , icarus is known for flying too close to the sun with dire consequences . his name has never broken into the national top 1000 , probably due his rash reputation and the icky sound of the first syllable of his name . inigo - inigo is another name that’s never ranked here , though it’s admired enough on nameberry to make it number 261 . it’s the medieval spanish version of ignatius , which has ranked as high as number 602 on the national list and was used by cate blanchett , but inigo is a no-go . llewellyn - a common name in wales , with the distinctive welsh double-l beginning , llewellyn appeared on the us list for six decades , ending in the early 1940s . but despite its rich welsh history , literary cred and quirky nicknames , llewelyn seems headed for extinction . remus - with his twin brother romulus , he was a legendary founder of rome . but the stereotypical image of uncle remus , plus the unpleasant first syllable , have kept him permanently off the top 1000 . sherwood - the stiff surname sherwood , which does have the distinguished namesake of influential novelist sherwood anderson , managed to make it onto the list from 1897 to 1963 , peaking at number 533 in 1938 , anderson’s heyday , but it hasn’t been heard from in the 7+ decades since then . waldo - where’s waldo ?

' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd . ' the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's ( computer ) system . a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . ' he added : ' we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . ' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gang’s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ? the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the company’s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . loot smuggled out of the country ? some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be ‘ a doddle’ . what about the ‘ king of diamonds’ ? a criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . the panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with £13million worth of jewellery .\n", "reference": "<t> locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist . </t> <t> they also tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises on evening of good friday . </t> <t> group seen returning to scene on saturday - a day after initial break-in . </t> <t> police admit they did n't respond after alarm went off early on friday . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Residents living yards from the scene of the # 60million Hatton Garden heist have revealed how they were hit by ` peculiar ' power cuts on the weekend before the daring crime .", "They also claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of Good Friday , but thought at the time that this was simply a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks .", "Meanwhile it has also been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery in central London to steal more loot after becoming ` greedy ' .", "Scotland Yard admitted last week that an alarm first went off at the scene after midnight on Good Friday , but it was graded as ` no police response was deemed to be required ' ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Residents live yards from the Hatton Garden heist scene.\",\n    \"The Hatton Garden heist was worth £60 million.\",\n    \"Residents experienced power cuts the weekend before the heist.\",\n    \"Residents heard drilling noises on Good Friday evening.\",\n    \"Residents thought the drilling was due to recent road works.\",\n    \"Thieves allegedly returned a day after the initial robbery.\",\n    \"Thieves stole more loot on their return.\",\n    \"The second theft was due to the thieves becoming greedy.\",\n    \"The initial robbery occurred in central London.\",\n    \"An alarm went off after midnight on Good Friday at the scene.\",\n    \"Scotland Yard admitted the alarm was triggered.\",\n    \"The alarm was graded as 'no police response required'.\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Residents live yards from the Hatton Garden heist scene.", "The Hatton Garden heist was worth £60 million.", "Residents experienced power cuts the weekend before the heist.", "Residents heard drilling noises on Good Friday evening.", "Residents thought the drilling was due to recent road works.", "Thieves allegedly returned a day after the initial robbery.", "Thieves stole more loot on their return.", "The second theft was due to the thieves becoming greedy.", "The initial robbery occurred in central London.", "An alarm went off after midnight on Good Friday at the scene.", "Scotland Yard admitted the alarm was triggered.", "The alarm was graded as 'no police response required'."]}

' leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . after being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . the singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . but can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . the partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . she even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently .

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["apple made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 plus , but they still fail to last more than a full day with typical usage .", "at least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops .", "to address these issues , the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Apple improved the battery life of iPhone 6.\",\n    \"Apple improved the battery life of iPhone 6 Plus.\",\n    \"iPhone 6 does not last more than a full day with typical usage.\",\n    \"iPhone 6 Plus does not last more than a full day with typical usage.\",\n    \"At least nine job listings were found on Apple's recruitment site.\",\n    \"Apple is seeking to boost battery life in its mobiles.\",\n    \"Apple is seeking to boost battery life in its laptops.\",\n    \"Apple is recruiting battery experts.\",\n    \"Apple is recruiting power software experts.\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Apple improved the battery life of iPhone 6.", "Apple improved the battery life of iPhone 6 Plus.", "iPhone 6 does not last more than a full day with typical usage.", "iPhone 6 Plus does not last more than a full day with typical usage.", "At least nine job listings were found on Apple's recruitment site.", "Apple is seeking to boost battery life in its mobiles.", "Apple is seeking to boost battery life in its laptops.", "Apple is recruiting battery experts.", "Apple is recruiting power software experts."]}

myhill from the edge of his area , the impression was firm that even the highly improbable can happen . this was quite likely the finest goal of zamora’s long career , a strike of rare quality that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangers’ season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this victory , only a second on the road all season , claws qpr closer to safety . bobby zamora ( left ) scored qpr 's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against west brom at the hawthorns . charlie austin ( right ) headed qpr 's second goal of the game for his team on the 35th minute . the qpr players went 2-0 up thanks to austin and ended up going in 3-0 ahead at half-time .

ramsey 8 . mom : barton . referee : lee probert 7 . att : 25,735 .   sportsmail 's match zone shows where bobby zamora struck qpr 's third goal . joey barton’s name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbu’s act in retribution for barton’s claims albion players had ‘s***’ themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramsey’s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes . for tony pulis , this was a bad day . his talks with chairman jeremy peace once safety is assured will have to wait . victor anichebe ( left ) headed in a consolation goal for west brom in the 58th after coming off the bench . joey barton ( centre ) added a fourth for qpr in the final minutes of the game against west brom . qpr captain barton celebrates his goal , his team 's fourth , in the game against west brom . youssouff mulumbu was shown a red card for clattering into joey barton , shortly before he scored for his side . barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . ‘ how s*** must you be , we’re winning away , ’ sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough . green ( left ) makes a save as west brom increased the pressure on qpr after scoring through anichebe . zamora ( left ) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike put them 3-0 up at half time . vargas ( centre ) celebrates with his qpr team-mates after opening the scoring in the 15th minute against west brom . sandro ( right ) makes a sliding challenge against west brom striker saido berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his team’s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris brunt’s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye headed another over . green , the qpr goalkeeper , celebrates his team 's opening goal from vargas .

' i am therefore confident that the italian government will now withdraw their application for a european arrest warrant and that mr rancadore will be discharged from these proceedings . ' there has been a long and unhappy history of these proceedings and i am delighted mr rancadore will now be able to live in peace in england with his wife and family . ' ms todner said she was waiting for the cps to sign a consent order so that the court could discharge rancadore . once the paperwork is in order , the matter will be listed at westminster magistrates ' court in london and a judge will then have to approve it . the italian mobster does not have to be present when the matter is dealt with in court . domenico rancadore , pictured with hiswife ann last year , will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence dropped . rancadore was first arrested on a european arrest warrant at his semi-detached london home in august 2013 . although he was never convicted of murder , the italian authorities wanted him to be returned to the country after he fled in 1995 . known as the professor , rancadore was tried in absentia and handed a seven-year prison term for his ' mafia association ' . he was convicted for his role as a ' man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders in palermo . during protracted extradition proceedings at westminster magistrates ' court , district judge howard riddle reversed his initial decision over concerns that italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition . in his judgment , judge riddle said : ' i am satisfied that , even without the assurance , there is no real risk that by returning this defendant to italy he will suffer inhuman or degrading treatment . ' before his arrest in 2013 , the mafia don spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house surrounded by a fence and large hedge , obscured from view . he claimed he had changed his name to escape the notoriety associated with his father , giuseppe . rancadore 's father was imprisoned in 1987 as part of the maxi trial which saw 475 mafiosi indicted . before his arrest in 2013 , rancadore spent two decades living under the name of marc skinner with his family in a house in uxbridge . there was an angry reaction from legal experts to the amount of time and money that had gone into rancadore 's case . extradition expert edward grange tweeted : ' what a waste of time and money . after two sets of proceedings , italy no longer seeks extradition of rancadore . ' mr grange , who is vice-chair of the extradition lawyers ' association , said : ' the purpose of the extradition request was for rancadore to be returned in order to serve a sentence of imprisonment . ' it transpires that as of october last year the italians could not actually legally enforce that sentence . ' so certainly from october onwards you would have thought that there would have been some communication from the italian authorities saying : `` hang on , we may have a problem here and we may not be able to continue with the extradition request '' . ' courts proceed on the basis of mutual trust and recognition , that is what we are told throughout in relation to the extradition and european arrest warrant scheme . ' it is something that is designed to be swift and quick and courts are supposed to trust what courts in the requesting state are saying . ' had the italians said in october we can not legally enforce this sentence and we therefore have to withdraw the european arrest warrant , i 'm sure our court would have encouraged them to do so as quickly as possible . ' domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra . asked about the costs of this kind of extradition process , mr grange said they were likely to be in the 'single-figure thousands rather than anything dramatic ' . barrister philip marshall qc said : ' yet more incompetence by the cps in the rancadore case ( allegedly ) : his seven-year prison sentence expired in october 2014 . ' there was no answer when reporters knocked on the door of rancadore 's home in manor way , uxbridge , london today . curtains were closed in all of the windows of the semi-detached house and a mercedes car was parked on the driveway . one neighbour claimed she was pleased it appeared he was not being extradited because ' you never know who will move in ' . she went on : ' he seems a nice chap and it happened a long time ago . ' the neighbour said she last saw rancadore around two weeks ago and he appeared to be suffering from ill-health . a court sketch of domenico rancadore . today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired last october and his european arrest warrant is to be withdrawn . sharon walker , who also lives nearby , said : ' they were a normal couple before and i 'm sure they will go back to being a normal couple . ' they are very quiet . i would not have said they are the most notorious couple in the street . also known as cosa nostra , which translates as ' our thing ' , the mafia emerged in sicily in the mid 19th century and is best described as a loose association of criminal groups sharing a common organisational structure and code of conduct . groups , often known as families or clans , will claim leadership of an area , usually a town or village , and operate rackets within it , using violence to punish those causing problems to their ' clients ' - who may well have been coerced into buying protection . most of the clans are led by a ' boss ' ( capofamiglia or rappresentante ) , who is aided by an underboss ( capo bastone or sotto capo ) and supervised by one or more advisers ( consigliere ) . only men are allowed to join the clans , and candidates are not allowed to have any links to lawmen such as police officers or judges . it has been estimated that the sicilian mafia costs the region 's economy more than €10 billion a year , and that roughly 70 per cent of sicilian businesses pay some sort of protection money . politicians have also been accused of using the mafia to buy votes during elections . the american mafia arose from offshoots of the cosa nostra that emerged in the united states during the late nineteenth century , following waves of emigration from italy . ' he 's very quiet . he always has been , even before it all blew up . they are a very quiet family . ' federico bianchi , head of press at the italian embassy , said : ' when , in march 2014 , the district judge denied the extradition of mr rancadore to italy , the crown prosecution service failed to appeal against his decision in the prescribed terms , for which they issued a formal excuse . ' that is key to the release of mr rancadore because that loss of time , which obliged italy to start the procedures afresh , issuing a new european arrest warrant , because that year that was lost gave the possibility for the sentence to expire . ' it gave the possibility to mr rancadore 's lawyers , who are clever and know the penal code very well , to file an application for the sentence to be declared expired . ' mr bianchi also denied that the hearing in february had been ' useless ' because the sentence had not automatically expired until it was confirmed as such by a court in palermo on march 25 . a cps spokesman said : ' the italian ministry of justice has confirmed that the decision by the court of appeal in palermo is appealable to the italian supreme court . ' it is inaccurate to suggest that a delay due to administrative errors has had a significant bearing on today 's outcome . ' until the european arrest warrant was officially withdrawn today , the cps acted on behalf of the italian authorities in these extradition proceedings and had received no instructions to the contrary . ' the cps admitted it had made a mistake by failing to serve appeal papers to rancadore 's lawyers on time in march last year . at the time , director of public prosecutions alison saunders acknowledged that , as a result of the error , it was possible rancadore would never be extradited to italy .\n", "reference": "<t> domenico rancadore given a seven-year sentence by italian court in 1999 . </t> <t> he was convicted for role as a ` man of honour ' , taking bribes from builders . </t> <t> in february the sicilian mafia fugitive lost battle against extradition to italy . </t> <t> today it emerged that the 65-year-old 's case expired in october last year . </t>\n", "sentences": ["domenico rancadore , who has lived in britain for more than 20 years , was given a seven-year sentence by an italian court in 1999 for being a member of the cosa nostra .", "in february he lost his year-and-a-half battle against extradition and was told he must return to italy to serve his sentence .", "a sicilian mafia fugitive dubbed the godfather of uxbridge who was set to be extradited to italy will be allowed to remain in the uk after his sentence was dropped ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Domenico Rancadore has lived in Britain for more than 20 years.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was sentenced for being a member of the Cosa Nostra.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore lost a year-and-a-half battle against extradition in February.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore is a Sicilian mafia fugitive.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore will be allowed to remain in the UK.\",\n    \"Domenico Rancadore's sentence was dropped.\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Domenico Rancadore has lived in Britain for more than 20 years.", "Domenico Rancadore was given a seven-year sentence by an Italian court in 1999.", "Domenico Rancadore was sentenced for being a member of the Cosa Nostra.", "Domenico Rancadore lost a year-and-a-half battle against extradition in February.", "Domenico Rancadore was told he must return to Italy to serve his sentence.", "Domenico Rancadore is a Sicilian mafia fugitive.", "Domenico Rancadore was dubbed the Godfather of Uxbridge.", "Domenico Rancadore was set to be extradited to Italy.", "Domenico Rancadore will be allowed to remain in the UK.", "Domenico Rancadore's sentence was dropped."]}

' apple defines the apple watch battery on its watch product page . it says its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use . all-day battery life : this includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . audio playback : the battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music . talk time : apple said the watch can be used for up to three hours for calls . workout : during this test the watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on . watch : when used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour . power reserve : when the apple watch 's battery gets low it switches into power reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour . charging time : the company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the watch to 80 % and 2.5 hours for a full charge . apple 's tests were carried out in march 2015 with a pre-production apple watch and software paired with an iphone using pre-production software . apple said battery life varies with environmental factors , use , configuration , and ' many other factors ' so actual results will vary . as the site suggests , this shows apple is looking to boost the battery on ios devices but also its range of macbooks . apple 's larger iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . these times have only been beaten by samsung 's latest galaxy s6 . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge . however , official figures suggest its watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long . boss tim cook said at the launch event last month that the watch will last 18 hours , but this only includes 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple is expected to launch an iphone 6s , 6s plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year . battery improvements could be made to these handsets , or they may be a feature on next year 's iphone 7 . alternatively , because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer , these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an ios upgrade . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person 's body . the sam l microcontrollers are part of atmel 's 32-bit arm-based mcu range and are powered by chip maker arm 's cortex m0+ 32-bit processors . a number of apple devices , including the iphone 5s and ipad air are powered by chips based around arm technology . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms , healthcare , medical , wearable , and devices placed in rural , agriculture , offshore and other remote areas . ' apple 's iphone 6 and 6 plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what ' normal usage ' is and this can differ from person to person . apple also said its new 12-inch macbook ( pictured ) uses 30 % less energy than previous models . apple boss tim cook said the watch 's 'all-day ' battery life lasts 18 hours with ' typical use ' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks , 90 notifications , 45 minutes of app use , and a 30-minute workout with music . apple defines the battery on its watch page and said a time check lasts four seconds . they use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made . the microcontrollers run on the firm 's picopower technology and atmel 's event system that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks . by effectively ' sharing ' energy , the whole device uses less power and , subsequently , less battery . it can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible . plus , the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature . earlier this week atmel released its latest microcontrollers ( mcus ) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person 's body . atmel said its mcus extend ' battery life from years to decades , reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices ' . during a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year 's ces , andreas eieland , atmel 's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel . this panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n", "reference": "<t> appleinsider spotted nine listings in the past month relating to batteries . </t> <t> these include one for an ios battery life software engineer and another for ios software power systems engineer . </t> <t> apple significantly improved the battery life on its iphone 6 and 6 plus . </t> <t> but it has been criticised for phones and tablets that only do n't last a day . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Fan site Appleinsider has spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries .", "These include one for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer and another for IOS Software Power Systems Engineer .", "Apple is also recruiting for a battery pack engineering manager and a Cell Engineer .", "It made significant improvements to the battery life of its iphone 6 and 6 Plus , but they still fail to last more than a day with typical usage ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\"key facts\": [\n\"Appleinsider is a fan site.\",\n\"Appleinsider spotted nine battery-related job listings on Apple's recruitment site.\",\n\"The job listings appeared in the past month.\",\n\"One job listing is for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer.\",\n\"Another job listing is for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer.\",\n\"Apple is recruiting a battery pack engineering manager.\",\n\"Apple is recruiting a Cell Engineer.\",\n\"Apple improved the battery life of the iPhone 6.\",\n\"Apple improved the battery life of the iPhone 6 Plus.\",\n\"iPhone 6 battery lasts less than a day with typical usage.\",\n\"iPhone 6 Plus battery lasts less than a day with typical usage.\"\n]}", "key_facts": ["Appleinsider is a fan site.", "Appleinsider spotted nine battery-related job listings on Apple's recruitment site.", "The job listings appeared in the past month.", "One job listing is for an IOS Battery Life Software Engineer.", "Another job listing is for an IOS Software Power Systems Engineer.", "Apple is recruiting a battery pack engineering manager.", "Apple is recruiting a Cell Engineer.", "Apple improved the battery life of the iPhone 6.", "Apple improved the battery life of the iPhone 6 Plus.", "iPhone 6 battery lasts less than a day with typical usage.", "iPhone 6 Plus battery lasts less than a day with typical usage."]}

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added . ' the one reason i wanted to play ( last year ) is because i love it and i never want to look back at my life , when i 'm older , and think ' i wish i 'd done that ' . ' i do n't see failing as a problem . but i see not having a go as a crime . ' so i thought `` i 'm going to have a go '' , and i certainly loved it .

{"doc_id": "cnndm19", "source": "cnndm", "split": "test", "model": "t5_out_large", "transcript": "( cnn ) on the surface , the mix-up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! i shot him . i 'm sorry , '' bates said in a video of the shooting . but it 's happened before . in a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . the former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? here are some factors to consider : law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , '' bates said in a written statement to investigators . after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , '' said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , '' brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . '' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt . jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence .

' under the varnish , traces of late medieval decoration have been found , ' he said . he has traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire to see the stanley family , who had helped him to victory in the battle of bosworth in 1485 . mr foyle said dna from the bed 's timber proved it once belonged to king henry vii ( pictured ) and he traced it back to 1495 , when henry vii went to lathom in lancashire . henry viii may have been conceived in the bed . the bed was snapped up by ian coulson , a four-poster bed specialist from northumberland , for £2,200 in 2010 after it was dumped in the car park of the former redland house hotel in hough green , chester ( above ) . tv historian jonathan foyle has spent years trying to prove the artefact 's historical roots and has now revealed that dna testing on the bed 's timber proved the medieval furniture once belonged to king henry vii . he also discovered that the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the carving also features biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures are accompanied by medieval symbols of fertility , such as acorns , bunches of grapes and strawberries . meanwhile , scribblings in a victorian furniture restorer 's diary suggested that the bed was at lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644 . mr foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of victorian revivalists by reflecting on the tudors ' belief that they had been chosen by god to save england from civil war . the bed features an inscription from the matthew bible of 1537 - reading : ' the stinge of death is sinne . the strength of sinne is the lawe ' - which was added after 1547 , when england had a protestant monarch . the bed also features carvings of biblical scenes of henry and his wife elizabeth of york styled as adam and eve , and as jesus christ and his mother , the virgin mary and the figures of medieval symbols of fertility . he said the headboard showed henry vii and his bride as adam and eve transmuted into christ - adding : ' it 's arguably the cradle of the english reformation . henry viii may have been conceived in bed . the carved four-poster bed , which has been revealed as henry viis , was reportedly created for the marriage of the first tudor king and his wife , elizabeth of york , on january 18 , 1486 . it is highly likely that the couple 's son , henry , was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the tudor dynasty . born at greenwich palace in 1491 , henry viii was the third child and second son of henry vii and his wife . only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 april , 1509 . under henry viii 's reign , england turned in favour of protestantism and split from rome , the royal navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded france . jonathan foyle , chief executive of world monuments fund britain , said : ' this bed belonged to henry viii . it has to be the most important piece of furniture [ in england ' - and arguably , royal artefact . ' he added : ' even the westminster coronation chair has less to say than this . ' experts believe henry vii may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son . ' look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of christ and mary ; it 's henry viii 's god complex in a nutshell . ' dr foyle described the 15th century artefact , which is considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in england , as ' a complete national treasure ' . he added : ' evidence suggests the bed was made for the painted chamber of westminster palace for the marriage ceremony at westminster abbey on january 18 , 1486 . ' mr foyle is backed by other experts , such as diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church at oxford university , who described the rediscovery as ' exceptionally important ' . the medieval bed is now reportedly worth up to £20million , although it is currently not up for sale and is instead on public display . it is part of the ' a bed of roses ' exhibition at the childhood home of anne boleyn , henry viii 's second wife , at hever castle in kent which also features a portrait of henry viii as a young man . the bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in england . in 2013 , the battle-scarred skeleton of richard iii was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in leicester . meanwhile , in december of the same year , archaeologists uncovered a site in the amazonian jungle believed to be the tomb of atahualpa , the last emporer of the incas . and last year , explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to alfred the great in the grounds of hyde abbey in winchester . henry vii 's four-poster bed will remain on display in the long gallery at hever castle in kent until november 22 .\n", "reference": "<t> four-poster bed dumped in a hotel car park and sold at auction for # 2,200 . </t> <t> owner suspected it had historic value and experts have been investigating . </t> <t> historian now claims dna from the timber proves it belonged to henry vii . </t> <t> ornate bed , now on display , was made for king and wife elizabeth of york . </t>\n", "sentences": ["The intricately - carved ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel in Hough Green , Chester , by builders who were renovating the property .", "It was snapped up for # 2,200 in 2010 by Ian Coulson .", "DNA testing on the bed once belonged to King Henry VII ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 0]}}, "llm_output": "{\"key facts\": [\n\"The ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel.\",\n\"The former Redland House Hotel is in Hough Green, Chester.\",\n\"Builders renovating the property left the bed.\",\n\"Ian Coulson bought the bed in 2010.\",\n\"Ian Coulson paid £2,200 for the bed.\",\n\"DNA testing was conducted on the bed.\",\n\"The bed once belonged to King Henry VII.\"\n]}", "key_facts": ["The ornate bed was left in the car park of the former Redland House Hotel.", "The former Redland House Hotel is in Hough Green, Chester.", "Builders renovating the property left the bed.", "Ian Coulson bought the bed in 2010.", "Ian Coulson paid £2,200 for the bed.", "DNA testing was conducted on the bed.", "The bed once belonged to King Henry VII."]}
