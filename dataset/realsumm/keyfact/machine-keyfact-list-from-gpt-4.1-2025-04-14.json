but his low shot was saved by scott bain . jake mcpake wheels away in celebration as helps dundee earn first derby win in over a decade . however , dundee broke the deadlock in the 14th minute through stewart . the home side 's top scorer turned smartly and hit a shot from 22 yards which should have been dealt with by cierzniak , but the polish keeper allowed the ball to trickle through his hands and into the net , leaving him red-faced . the lead , however , was short-lived as united levelled two minutes later . chris erksine 's powerful shot came off the hand off dark blues skipper kevin thomson 's hand , and referee john beaton pointed straight to the spot . up stepped ciftci to send bain the wrong way and square things up . dundee utd goalkeeper radoslaw cierzniak looks back at his goal after mark stewart opened the scoring . stewart celebrates his derby goal with a fan as he runs over to the home faithful at den park . however , dundee regained the lead in the 23rd minute when stewart 's corner was met by mcpake , who rose above jaroslaw fojut head past cierzniak from six yards . as the half-hour mark approached , united came close to equalising when aidan connolly jinked in from the left before unleashing a venomous shot which bain was relieved to see clear his crossbar . the tangerines were desperate for an equaliser before the break and in the 35th minute dixon 's whipped cross was met by connolly - but his left-foot effort went wide . dundee utd 's chris erskine goes down under a challenge from stephen mcginn during the dundee derby . united attempted to step up a gear and john rankin 's 56th-minute shot was deflected just wide by stewart for a corner . at the other end , dundee 's paul mcgowan released paul mcginn down the right and his cross picked out heffernan - but the striker mishit the shot and the chance was not taken . however , heffernan was not to be denied and the irish ace killed the contest midway through the second half . dundee 's paul heffernan taps home his side 's third goal of the game as they close in on derby victory . skipper thomson sent stewart clear on the left and his cross was perfect for heffernan to calmly knock home at the far post . mcgowan almost made it 4-1with 10 minutes of the contest remaining , only for cierzniak to defy him with a fingertip save from his header . however , the hard work had already been done by the hosts -

junior colleague recorder stuart trimmer qc ( right ) for ' taking his eye off the ball ' when he sentenced christopher starrs in january this year . both starrs and tamplin , 53 , who made Â£124,000 from the con , admitted submitting the string of bogus expenses . tamplin was jailed for two years at january 's sentencing hearing , but mr recorder stuart trimmer qc spared starrs jail as an â€˜ act of mercyâ€™ - although he ordered him to repay the money he took and pay a Â£1,500 fine . however , senior judge nicholas cooke qc has now said the sentence was â€˜unlawfulâ€™ - and added starrs should have been sent to prison for his crimes . â€˜ it was an unlawful sentence passed and now i need to do something to put it right , because it was negligence on the parties involved in the matter , â€™ he said . â€˜ he was mercifully dealt with , sadly by a judge who didnâ€™t have his eye on the ball . â€™ the judge told mark haslam , defending : â€˜ the sentence was wrong but thatâ€™s a matter of personal opinion . â€˜ your client was fortunate to not go straight to prison . â€˜ what the recorder did was to impose a package of sentencing options that wasnâ€™t available to him . â€˜ no one appears to have noticed that the sentencing imposed on mr starrs was unlawful . â€˜ i am sorry to be the headmaster but we really donâ€™t want this sort of thing . â€™ fraud : wheelchair-bound starrs , 50 , was a manager with bt who admitted defrauding the company of Â£28,000 over two years . the recorder , who is the head of 4 bream buildings chambers and took the silk in 2006 , gave starrs a 16-month jail sentence suspended for two years and ordered to pay a fine , and allowed the confiscation proceeds to continue . but judge cooke said it was not possible to imposed a financial penalty at the same time as postponing a confiscation order . turning his fire on the barristers who were at the sentencing hearing , he added : â€˜ this is supposed to be a centre of excellence , when you expect the representatives to point out what we can and canâ€™t do . â€˜ the judge should have been told what his powers were . â€™ prosecutor john ojakovoh said starrs offered a â€˜ blank chequeâ€™ at sentencing and has already paid back the Â£28,000 he stole . after the judge heard the cps will now drop the confiscation proceedings , he said the original sentence will stand , quipping : â€˜ he no doubt thanks his lucky stars . â€™ both barristers admitted they had failed to spot the sentencing blunder at the time . the main fraudulent claim was for bt vehicles which had been â€˜clampedâ€™ by parking authorities . bt openreach workers are allowed to claim back parking tickets on expenses as they are regularly forced to park their vans illegally to carry out their work . the company pays out around Â£1million in fines in london alone every year . starrs and tamplin used an authentic clamping ticket to reproduce reams of duplicates . sentencing recorder trimmer , who has led a string of high-profile serious fraud office prosecutions in the last two years , said : â€˜ this was a sophisticated fraud perpetrated over a very long period of time . â€˜ it involved over 100 or so false claims , made within the context of a large organisation that was open to fraudulent activity . â€˜ both of you were in the position of managers within that organisation and both well knew how open the organisation was to fraudulent activity . â€˜ you both knew how it could be conducted , concealed and be made to benefit each of you personally . â€™ starrs , of northolt , middlesex

' leanne won the public vote in the final of the voice uk 's first ever series , but her debut single , a cover of whitney houston 's i would run to you only just managed to scrape into the top 50 after being released . leanne mitchell has now returned to her previous employment , singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk , after failing to make her mark on the music industry . after being dropped by her label decca , leanne is now working in the job she thought she 'd left behind - singing for holiday campers at potters leisure resort in hopton-on-sea , norfolk . the singer has defended her efforts , suggesting that she was given poor advice and not enough support once she 'd finished writing her album . but can the same be said for series two winner , andrea begley ? former the voice uk coach danny o'donoghue criticised leanne mitchell for not working hard enough after winning series one of the bbc talent show , but has failed to make his own winning act , andrea begley , who was crowned champion of the second series in 2013 , into a household name either . partially sighted irish singer andrea was determined to avoid the mistakes of her predecessor leanne , but despite enjoying more chart success amd holding onto her record deal , she too has failed to equal the superstardom that comes with winning other tv talent shows like simon cowell 's the x factor . the partially sighted singer from pomeroy , northern ireland , now 29 , won the public vote in 2013 after being mentored by fellow irishman , danny . she even commented on the failings of her predecessor leanne , and said that she was determined to do things differently . ' everybody is obviously aware that last year things did n't go maybe as well as they could 've done , and i think lessons have been learned , ' she told the mirror , shortly after being crowned champ . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the singer 's disappointment . but while andrea is still fortunate enough to have herself a record deal , her success has n't been the chart topping megastardom that winning a rival show like the x factor might bring . her debut single , a cover of evanescence 's my immortal , charted at number 30 , while her follow up , dancing in the dark , originally by bruce springsteen , did n't make it any further than 113 . andrea 's album , the message , released in october 2013 did make it to number seven in the album charts , but compare that to the success of most x factor winners , and you soon understand the deflation in the begley camp . will.i.am won the third series of the voice uk with jermain jackman , a young singer from hackney , london . 2014 the voice winner jermain saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at just number 75 . hot on the heels of andrea was jermain jackman , who won last year 's series with coach will.i.am . if a slow start killed leanne mitchell 's chances , jermain and will had better kick this career into gear . the singer from hackney in london , still just 20-years-old , saw his debut single and i am telling you , a cover of the broadway number made famous by jennifer hudson in musical dreamgirls , chart at number 75 . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . compared with x factor 's 2014 winner ben haenow , whose debut single landed the christmas number one spot , jermain 's success has so far been what you could call limited . despite various public appearances , once with mitch winehouse ( pictured centre ) at a charity event in the name of his late daughter amy winehouse , jermain 's debut album this month has landed at number 42 . the glitter falls from the ceiling ... but the real hard work is just beginning for stevie mccrorie . so can stevie mccrorie break the curse and become the first ever success of the voice uk ? his debut single will be lost stars , a cover of adam levine 's hit from the film begin again , which was nominated for an oscar this year . the scotsman has also reportedly been asked to perform at music festival t in the park already . stevie 's coach ricky wilson , frontman of rock band kaiser chiefs , has been quick to defend his protege in the face of criticism . when asked if he 's worried about the growing number of the voice uk flops , he simply replied , ' stevie has n't won it before . ' so now it 's all eyes on you stevie ! no pressure ... though it 's not always the winners who reap all the success ( steve brookstein , case in point ) , the x factor has produced far more chart successes than the voice uk . here are just a few of the best-selling artists that came from simon cowell 's itv show : one direction they did n't win , in fact they came third , runners up next to matt cardle and rebecca ferguson in 2010 , but simon cowell 's boyband has sold over 50 million albums and quite literally , taken over the world with their legion of fans . leona lewis despite having left simon cowell 's label sycon last year , leona remains one of the show 's biggest successes , having sold over 4.4 million singles off the back of her 2006 win . jls the runners-up of the 2009 series , jls went on to sell over 3.9 million singles and 2.7 million albums , before splitting up in 2013 . olly murs he came second to joe mcelderry in 2009 , then went on to sell almost as many albums as jls and co-present the x factor 's sister show xtra factor in itv2 with caroline flack . alexandra burke after winning the 2009 series following her duet with beyonce , alexandra went on to rack up more than 1.25 million sales for her debut single hallelujah . james arthur before the singer landed himself in hot water with volatile twitter rants , he clocked up over 1.2 million sales of his first single impossible after winning the 2012 series . little mix the first ever group to win the show in 2011 , little mix have now beaten the spice girls ' chart success in america and raked up an impressive 132million vevo views . rebecca ferguson though she came second to matt cardle in the 2010 series , rebecca has just released her third album lady sings the blues and has enjoyed steady chart success .\n", "reference": "<t> leanne mitchell has been dropped by her label and sings at a holiday camp . </t> <t> andrea begley and jermain jackman are yet to become household names . </t> <t> will 2015 winner stevie become a chart success or another voice flop ? </t>\n", "sentences": ["stevie mccrorie has been crowned the winner of the voice uk 2015 , after beating fellow contestant lucy o'byrne in the final .", "now mentor ricky wilson , his fellow celebrity judges rita ora , tom jones and will.i.am , and most of all bosses at the bbc will all have their fingers crossed for his success .", "his mentor ricky wilson is confident stevie could be just what the bbc needs to pull their talent show out of ridicule ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 0, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Stevie McCrorie won The Voice UK 2015.\",\n    \"Stevie McCrorie beat Lucy O'Byrne in the final.\",\n    \"Ricky Wilson was Stevie McCrorie's mentor.\",\n    \"Rita Ora was a judge on The Voice UK 2015.\",\n    \"Tom Jones was a judge on The Voice UK 2015.\",\n    \"Will.i.am was a judge on The Voice UK 2015.\",\n    \"The BBC broadcasts The Voice UK.\",\n    \"Ricky Wilson is confident in Stevie McCrorie's potential.\",\n    \"Ricky Wilson believes Stevie McCrorie could improve The Voice UK's reputation.\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Stevie McCrorie won The Voice UK 2015.", "Stevie McCrorie beat Lucy O'Byrne in the final.", "Ricky Wilson was Stevie McCrorie's mentor.", "Rita Ora was a judge on The Voice UK 2015.", "Tom Jones was a judge on The Voice UK 2015.", "Will.i.am was a judge on The Voice UK 2015.", "The BBC broadcasts The Voice UK.", "Ricky Wilson is confident in Stevie McCrorie's potential.", "Ricky Wilson believes Stevie McCrorie could improve The Voice UK's reputation."]}

' he 's a fantastic player , but nobody just walks into any team - especially the england team , ' i 'm back , i 'm here , i 'm playing ' , ' flintoff told press association sport . england have won their last three tests under cook , pre-dating a miserable world cup , and took a three-figure first-innings lead in the first match of three in the west indies . pietersen has not featured for england since he was unceremoniously sacked 14 months ago . it is hard to identify anyone in their middle order who should step aside , on current form . ' which of them do you say `` you 're not playing ! '' for kevin to come in ? ' flintoff said . ' i just think kevin is running out of time a little bit . ' if he 'd started the season last year with surrey , and scored run after run and put himself in the position ... whereas now i think he 's looking at the ashes and he 's just running out of time . ' that 's not to say he ( definitely ) wo n't feature , but i ca n't imagine it 's going to be in the near future . ' flintoff is optimistic about england 's fortunes , despite their winter woes , with or without pietersen . ' alastair cook is so important , and you get the sense everyone within the england set-up wants him as captain , ' he said . ' he 's a popular lad , and a great player . ' peter moores , there are n't enough words for me to describe how great he is as a person and coach - an amazing bloke . ' the former england star is hoping to win back his test place with a return to red ball cricket . england , flintoff believes , just need a little more support . ' i think sometimes as a pundit , ex-player , you forget how difficult it can be , ' he added . ' in australia , you have all the ex-players talking to the current players and you get a sense that everyone wants australia to do well . ' with england , i 've never had a sense of that . ' it 's about time we started talking them up . i think it 's time we started supporting the side , getting behind cook , moores , the players . ' it 's very easy to take cheap shots and swipes and pick out a player who has n't moved his feet . ( i think ) maybe we should be a bit better than that , and start celebrating the lads a bit . ' he is enthusiastic too about this summer 's t20 blast , insisting it is no poor relation of the indian premier league - or the big bash , in which he played last winter for brisbane heat . flintoff says alastair cook is so important to england despite poor showing in the first test against west indies . flintoff said : ' the competition gets stronger . it 's probably the premier tournament of the domestic game now , with the crowds and excitement behind it . ' we 're seeing that , with some of the players coming over - the world 's best , chris gayle , brendon mccullum , ( glenn ) maxwell , ( aaron ) finch . ' i played in the big bash , and the standard was high ( but ) this stands up as a competition . ' you turn up at old trafford for lancashire-yorkshire , and get 25,000 people , then to chelmsford where they 're playing in front of packed houses - so i do n't subscribe to that . ' anything in this country , we look at things abroad and say everything is far better over there . ' we do n't really focus on what we 've got . flintoff shares a joke with players at the natwest t20 blast launch at edgbaston on thursday . ' i did n't see anything within the big bash and thought ' this is far better than what we 've got at home ' . ' whether at 37 he will be a part of the blast again , after coming out of retirement and so nearly helping lancashire to win the tournament last summer , is another matter . ' i 'm not arrogant enough to think i can just walk into the lancashire dressing-room and say ' i 'm back , i 'm playing ' , ' he added .

' i do n't think this was part of the plan . but criminals are greedy . ' mr smith went on to state the raid was likely organised by a ' mr big ' who organised an elite crew made up of europeans and israelis , unknown to each other , acting on his inside information . cctv shows the gang of at least six men breaking into a basement side door at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd building . it is now known they then took stairs to the second floor , disabled a lift and abseiled down the shaft to get to the vault , avoiding security doors . the footage is from the bottom of a fire escape by the basement side door . at 9.23pm on the thursday , just minutes after employees left for the easter bank holiday weekend , a red-haired man wearing a baseball cap was the first to arrive and headed downstairs to the vault . a street camera then picked up a white ford transit van drawing up outside and men were seen dragging wheelie bins away before the van left . the men , wearing high-visibility jackets and hard hats , carried large holdalls and dragged the wheelie bins downstairs towards the vault . it is thought that one of the bins contained the 77lb drill used to bore through the 6ft-thick vault wall . on good friday , at 7.51am the raiders emerged through the basement side door with holdalls , tools and the bins , now believed to be filled with diamonds , cash and jewellery . the van was seen pulling up again before the men loaded it and drove off . at 10.17pm on saturday , the cameras showed three of the men returning with holdalls and tool boxes . from 5.46am on sunday , the gang went back and forth four times with a wheelie bin from the vault to the van . they then loaded up the van and drove off at 6.44am . in total , 72 safety deposit boxes were opened out of 999 boxes in the vault . possible identities suggested for the thieves have ranged from russian gangsters to former serbian military personnel , or that they are part of the ' pink panther gang ' from the balkans . scotland yard was branded as ' incompetent ' last week after admitting it got a call at 0.20am on the friday from a company who monitors alarms across the south east , but instead of acting on it , deemed it ' no police response required ' . a police spokesman said : ' the call stated that a confirmed intruder alarm had been activated at the hatton garden safe deposit ltd .

' in response to whether officers had spoken to residents about the power cuts and ' drilling ' noises , a police spokesman declined to comment . meanwhile , a ukip candidate who is under investigation for handing out sausage rolls to voters has revealed that he may have lost valuables in the hatton garden burglary . kim rose , a jeweller who is standing in the southampton itchen constituency in hampshire , had a box at the safe deposit hit in the raid . the 58-year-old made headlines last week when it emerged that police want to question him after a report that he tried to woo potential voters with refreshments at a party event . mr rose is still waiting to hear whether his was among 72 boxes which were taken in the burglary and will be interviewed by police tomorrow morning over the sausage roll claims . where were the gang from ? speculation over the gangâ€™s origin has been feverish . possible identities put forward have ranged from former serbian military personnel to russian gangsters , or that they are members of the so-called pink panther gang from the balkans , who have carried out robberies across europe . however , the pink panthers have been violent and aggressive in the past , which was not the case here . an accomplice on the inside ? the men reached the fire exit through an alley leading from a side street in hatton garden , but this alley is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key . furthermore , there was no sign of a forced entry through the fire exit door into the companyâ€™s premises , indicating they had a key or that someone had let them in from the inside . another theory is that a member of the gang had rented a space within the premises . loot smuggled out of the country ? some believe the haul was stolen to order for the middle eastern market . whoever their buyer , it is agreed by police , former robbers and crime experts that the gems are likely to have already left the country - and probably very soon after the raid . according to one former robber quoted in a newspaper at the weekend , getting the goods out of the country would be â€˜ a doddleâ€™ . what about the â€˜ king of diamondsâ€™ ? a criminal mastermind known as the ' king of diamonds ' was named last week among the prime suspects . the only known picture of the mysterious robber comes from an unsolved raid on a knightsbridge 's graff diamond store in 2007 . the panama hat-wearing raider entered the exclusive shop after jumping out of a chauffeur-driven bentley . he and an accomplice then pulled out guns and made off with Â£13million worth of jewellery .\n", "reference": "<t> locals say power cuts the weekend before raid could be linked to heist . </t> <t> they also tell of suspicious ` drilling ' noises on evening of good friday . </t> <t> group seen returning to scene on saturday - a day after initial break-in . </t> <t> police admit they did n't respond after alarm went off early on friday . </t>\n", "sentences": ["Residents living yards from the scene of the # 60million Hatton Garden Heist have revealed how they were hit by ` Peculiar ' power cuts .", "They also claim to have heard ` drilling ' noises on the evening of Good Friday , but thought this was a continuation of road works that had been taking place in recent weeks .", "Meanwhile it has been alleged that the thieves returned a day after the initial robbery to steal more loot after becoming ` greedy ' ."], "raw_annotations": {"0": {"key_fact_labels": [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "1": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}, "2": {"key_fact_labels": [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0], "sentence_labels": [1, 1, 1]}}, "llm_output": "{\n  \"key facts\": [\n    \"Residents live yards from the Hatton Garden Heist scene.\",\n    \"The Hatton Garden Heist involved Â£60 million.\",\n    \"Residents experienced peculiar power cuts.\",\n    \"Residents heard drilling noises on Good Friday evening.\",\n    \"Residents thought the drilling noises were road works.\",\n    \"Road works had been taking place in recent weeks.\",\n    \"Thieves allegedly returned a day after the initial robbery.\",\n    \"Thieves returned to steal more loot.\",\n    \"Thieves returned due to greed.\"\n  ]\n}", "key_facts": ["Residents live yards from the Hatton Garden Heist scene.", "The Hatton Garden Heist involved Â£60 million.", "Residents experienced peculiar power cuts.", "Residents heard drilling noises on Good Friday evening.", "Residents thought the drilling noises were road works.", "Road works had been taking place in recent weeks.", "Thieves allegedly returned a day after the initial robbery.", "Thieves returned to steal more loot.", "Thieves returned due to greed."]}

boaz myhill from the edge of his area , the impression was firm that even the highly improbable can happen . this was quite likely the finest goal of zamoraâ€™s long career , a strike of rare quality that never looked on seconds before the ball was in the back of the net . chris ramsey will hope queens park rangersâ€™ season can follow a similarly implausible trajectory . written off by many , this victory , only a second on the road all season , claws qpr closer to safety . bobby zamora ( left ) scored qpr 's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against west brom at the hawthorns . charlie austin ( right ) headed qpr 's second goal of the game for his team on the 35th minute . the qpr players went 2-0 up thanks to austin and ended up going in 3-0 ahead at half-time . eduardo vargas ( left ) wheels away to celebrate firing qpr into the lead against west brom with a 25-yard strike .  west bromwich albion : myhill 5 ; baird 5 ( olsson 65â€™ 4 ) , mcauley 4 , lescott

manager : chris ramsey 8 . mom : barton . referee : lee probert 7 . att : 25,735 .   sportsmail 's match zone shows where bobby zamora struck qpr 's third goal . joey bartonâ€™s name was sung loud by travelling fans at the final whistle , in recognition of a fine display capped by a goal in added time to give this win an emphatic scoreline . he drove onto a lose ball in the west bromwich albion box and lashed home with the ferocity of someone determined not to go down with a whimper . earlier , in the 84th minute , he received a forearm in the face from substitute youssouf mulumbu that saw referee lee probert produce a red card . was mulumbuâ€™s act in retribution for bartonâ€™s claims albion players had â€˜s***â€™ themselves when leading 2-0 at loftus road in december to lose 3-2 ? only he will know . what is without question is that ramseyâ€™s team are fighting for their lives . five successive defeats preceded this game , but three points paints fresh gloss on their survival hopes . for tony pulis , this was a bad day . his talks with chairman jeremy peace once safety is assured will have to wait . victor anichebe ( left ) headed in a consolation goal for west brom in the 58th after coming off the bench . joey barton ( centre ) added a fourth for qpr in the final minutes of the game against west brom . qpr captain barton celebrates his goal , his team 's fourth , in the game against west brom . youssouff mulumbu was shown a red card for clattering into joey barton , shortly before he scored for his side . barton ( left ) lies on the ground holding his head after the foul that saw mulumbu dismissed from the pitch . albion had the first clear opening in the 14th minute . darren fletcher swung over a deep cross to find brown ideye , but the nigeria striker directed his header above the bar . moments later , the visitors were ahead in stunning fashion . a long ball by robert green was helped on by zamora and nodded into the path of vargas by austin . the chilean cut across two west brom defenders and let fly a cracking shot the other direction , utterly defeating myhill from 25 yards . â€˜ how s*** must you be , weâ€™re winning away , â€™ sang the travelling hoard . the hosts responded , with a cross by chris baird sent trickling wide by ideye four yards out . soon after vargas went down clutching his knee with nobody near him . baird continued play to the fury of sandro , who rushed over once the ball had gone dead to remonstrate in rather close proximity to the albion defender . vargas tried to continue but hobbled off minutes later , bringing the introduction of niko kranjcar . the croatian delivered a telling contribution in the 37th minute , flicking on a corner by matt phillips to find austin unmarked at the far post . the qpr striker applied the finishing touch as expected to take his premier league tally to 16 , his fourth against west brom following a hat-trick in the fixture at loftus road . two minutes before the interval , zamora provided that moment to take the breath . phillips played the ball to the forward but danger seemed distant by the corner of the area . instead zamora glanced a shot with the outside of his left boot to send the ball soaring high before dropping into the corner of the net . it was joyous . qpr had done enough . green ( left ) makes a save as west brom increased the pressure on qpr after scoring through anichebe . zamora ( left ) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike put them 3-0 up at half time . vargas ( centre ) celebrates with his qpr team-mates after opening the scoring in the 15th minute against west brom . sandro ( right ) makes a sliding challenge against west brom striker saido berahino . green ( centre ) makes a save for qpr as berahino closes in on goal in the game at the hawthorns . pulis , no doubt furious with his teamâ€™s defending , introduced victor anichebe at half-time and his big frame had a sizeable effect . in the 55th minute presented a very appealing chance for craig gardner but only a tame shot followed . three minutes later anichebe had a goal for himself . saido berahino latched onto chris bruntâ€™s long pass and dug out a cross that anichebe reached ahead of steven caulker to steer into the far corner . pulis replaced chris baird with jonas olsson and changed to a 3-4-3 formation , instigating an albion surge . robert green punched clear a deflected shot by ideye . berahino ten scuffed an excellent chance from four yards and ideye headed another over . green , the qpr goalkeeper , celebrates his team 's opening goal from vargas . barton ( centre ) has his shirt pulled by craig gardner of west brom in the premier league game . west brom captain darren fletcher ( centre ) contests a header with qpr 's sandro . anichebe 's attacking threat is stifled by yook suk-young ( left ) and barton ( right ) of qpr . niko kranjcar ( left ) of qpr and james morrison ( right ) of west brom battle for the ball
